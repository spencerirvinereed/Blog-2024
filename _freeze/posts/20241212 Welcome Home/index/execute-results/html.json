We worried that they would slow down the group.\n\nThere was no need for that.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed visiting sites associated with the birth and flourishing of Western Civilization\n\n![Zaanse Schans, October 2001](images/IMG_0030.JPG){width=\"75%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-fae509e1fad8e6558c4c\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-fae509e1fad8e6558c4c\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[52.47500366703911,4.820575078680284,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"Zaandijk, Netherlands\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"setView\":[{\"lat\":52.47500366703911,\"lng\":4.820575078680284},14,[]],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[52.47500366703911,52.47500366703911],\"lng\":[4.820575078680284,4.820575078680284]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne thing we couldn't arrange was return to their 고향 (故鄕).\n\nThe Korean Wikipedia has three definitions.\n\n-   the place of birth and growing up\n-   the place where your ancestors lived for generations\n-   that place you miss and cherish deep in your heart.\n\nMy mother and father knew exactly the place of their birth and childhood home. If the borders were abolished, I think they could lead a group of visitors right up to the neighborhood.\n\nI imagine, they could have done that even in their 80s.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA few years after the European visit, we got to visit 백령도 (白翎島). An island, about 200 kilometers from Incheon Airport, or a 4-hour ferry ride. The island is inhabited by 5000 persons, including Mom's cousin on her mother's side.\n\n![With the cousin in front of local Presbyterian Church, June 2007](images/DSCN0271%201.JPG){width=\"75%\"}\n\nWhen we arrived on the island. I didn't need an introduction, I was instantly accepted as a family, by virtue of being my mom's son. My 2 sons were automatically recognized as an extended family.\n\nThis was a rare and memorable welcoming for me as a son of refugees from the Northern Korea.\n\nMom's cousin and his wife provided a feast and took us around the island. The island is roughly 50 square kilometers or 1/15 of Singapore.\n\n![At mom's cousin's Home, light on spices, closer to North Korean cuisine](images/DSC00427.JPG){width=\"50%\"}\n\nMany of its residents are from nearby counties in North Korea. Some of these are less than 10 miles from the coast of 백령도 (白翎島).\n\nThey came to the island in a temporary arrangement. They were to return, once the conflict was resolved.\\\n\nThat was nearly 74 years ago.\n\n![콩돌해안, beach on the east side of the island](images/DSC00382.JPG){width=\"75%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-16a4371f493ad57d2cdd\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-16a4371f493ad57d2cdd\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[37.97141498545955,124.718225896251,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"백령도 (혜원약국), 인천\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"setView\":[{\"lat\":37.97141498545955,\"lng\":124.718225896251},14,[]],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[37.97141498545955,37.97141498545955],\"lng\":[124.718225896251,124.718225896251]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n---\n\nI don't know whether I will step foot on North Korea.\n\nEven if I did, who would guide me to our family's hometown.\n\nAnd then if we did meet the extended family, what would the conversation consist of.\n\nNevertheless, I hope to fulfill the wishes of my parents and visit those places and say.\n\n> \"I am home (ただいま)\"\n\nand they will respond,\n\n> 'Welcome Home\"\n\nただいま帰りました (Tadaima kaerimashita)\n\n> I have returned, indeed.\n",
