Mother and her helper making 김치](images/Epson_12242024100109-EDIT.jpg){width=\"65%\"}\n\nThe process began with selecting cabbages from wholesalers.\n\nAt the time, we lived in 주안 and the supplies for 김치 was not fully available. Mom arranged 배추 to be delivered to the home.\n\nThen cabbages would be delivered using 리어카(RearCar/リヤカー).\n\n[I followed the older man, (he looked old, but was not even 50) delivering cabbages home. Pushing the cart on the uphill. It was about a 5km journey, according to Google map, but for a young person, it seemed much longer.]\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-ec6d83aac80d4fe5e800\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-ec6d83aac80d4fe5e800\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[37.45467381059076,126.6741463898317,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"인천주안초등학교\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"setView\":[{\"lat\":37.45467381059076,\"lng\":126.6741463898317},14,[]],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[37.45467381059076,37.45467381059076],\"lng\":[126.6741463898317,126.6741463898317]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nI estimate scores of cabbages, approaching 100 were purchased and delivered.\n\n[It is possible, 김치 was made and divided among families]\n\nMy mom would orchestrate the production of 김치.\n\nWe shared a common wall with the elementary school. Between the wall was a space, with a protective awning of transparent plastic. My dad or his younger brother, who was living with us, must have dug a hole in the ground for the 항아리 to be buried.\n\n> an earthenware vessel with a narrow top and bottom and a bulging middle, used for storing and preserving items\n\nThese were good sized potteries. About 3 feet high with a 3 feet diameter at its peak width.  (The actual size may have been smaller, everything seemed bigger when you were young)\n\n![Spring 1999, 장독 with 항아리, 뱀밭, near 현충사](images/fam180499.jpg)\n\nI recall breaking ice to access cabbages and radishes during winter months.\n\nThese provide nourishment we needed during those months when no fresh vegetables were available.\n\nI remember the crisp, naturally preserved, flavor of radishes. Mom would slice them into size of thin french fries and and bit of vinegar and red pepper.\n\nThat was how we survived long winter months during growing up years in 인천.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFull Definition of 김장from NamuWiki\n\n[겨울](https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B2%A8%EC%9A%B8 \"겨울\") 동안 먹을 다량의 [김치](https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B9%80%EC%B9%98 \"김치\")를 늦가을이나 초겨울에 담그는 행위 또는 그렇게 담근 김치를 일컫는 말. 주로 11월이나 12월에 김장을 한다.\\^\\[<https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B9%80%EC%9E%A5>\\]\n\nThe act of making a large quantity of kimchi during late autumn or early winter to be consumed throughout the winter, or the kimchi made in this way.
