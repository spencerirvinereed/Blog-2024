To drive that distance takes nearly six hours.\n\nThe Hikari Shinkansen option costs 13,320 but it will take you there in 2 hours and 40 minutes using the Hikari, the limited express option.\n\nSee Table and Chart Below\n\nHere’s a tabulated list showing the **travel time** and **cost** from Tokyo to Kyoto using the three different Shinkansen types (Nozomi, Hikari, and Kodama) and their seat classes:\n\n| **Shinkansen Type** | **Seat Type**           | **Travel Time**    | **Cost (JPY)** | **Cost (USD)** (approx.) |\n|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **Nozomi**          | Ordinary (Reserved)     | 2 hours 15 minutes | ¥13,870        | \\$93                     |\n|                     | Green Car (First Class) | 2 hours 15 minutes | ¥19,390        | \\$130                    |\n|                     | Ordinary (Unreserved)   | 2 hours 15 minutes | ¥13,620        | \\$91                     |\n| **Hikari**          | Ordinary (Reserved)     | 2 hours 40 minutes | ¥13,320        | \\$90                     |\n|                     | Green Car (First Class) | 2 hours 40 minutes | ¥18,890        | \\$127                    |\n|                     | Ordinary (Unreserved)   | 2 hours 40 minutes | ¥13,080        | \\$88                     |\n| **Kodama**          | Ordinary (Reserved)     | 4 hours            | ¥13,320        | \\$90                     |\n|                     | Green Car (First Class) | 4 hours            | ¥18,890        | \\$127                    |\n|                     | Ordinary (Unreserved)   | 4 hours            | ¥13,080        | \\$88                     |\n\n### Notes:\n\n-   Prices are one-way.\n-   **Nozomi** is the fastest but not covered by the Japan Rail Pass.\n-   **Hikari** and **Kodama** are slower but covered by the JR Pass.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
