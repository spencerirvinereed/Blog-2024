The year 2005 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the decision of destiny for Asia, the creation of the Northern Far East Mission and the Southern Far East Mission. Accordingly, now is the perfect time to document this great event.

Notwithstanding the excellence of the extant histories of the church in the far east, there is yet room for a work covering the history of the Northern Far East Mission and the Southern Far East Mission and the special role for which they were created, that is, to prepare Japan, Korea, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines to become the stepping stones to all of the nations of Asia.
