One way to gauge your influence find your status in the family is to invite more people to your home than you have beds and bedrooms.

Such was an occasion during a family wedding.

Some visitors chose to go the Airbnb route or a traditional hotel stay.
Some, however, chose the more established means – staying with relatives.

## Current Stock

That kicked off the planning and selction process.

Which visiting family gets which bedrooms and who gets to sleep on the floor versus beds.

I missed the cut on both and wound up sleeping on the floor with a mat.

The mat was about 30” by 72” (I measured since it looked kind of narrow).
The size of the mat and the material seemed familiar.

It was similar to a business class, lie flat, offerings for long distance flights.
Both in terms of construction material and the aforementioned dimensions.

Only missing items were the entertainment console with a private reading lamp and attendant call button.

## Past Travels

There was a time when I would look forward to long flights.

The prevailing rule for long distance travel was, if the travel was longer than 8 hours, everyone traveled in the Business Class.

Business class meant more comfortable seating that became lie down beds in the sky.

My stock had fallen far and quickly.

## Comfortable Sleeping

This time around, with the makeshift bedding, I was a few inches off the ground.
There was no need to worry about falling off.

I slept as well as I did on my regular bed.
Unlike those trips abroad. I didn’t need the help of noise cancellation headphones or had the distraction of dozens of movies on demand.

Sleeping on the floor, with the heating vents and pipes built into the floor^[https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%98%A8%EB%8F%8C], is the traditional Korean way. 

The way I was raised for the first 10 years

## Travels : courtesy of corporations

Nearly all of my travels abroad and some within the United States were made possible due to my employment.

Worked for a company that was expanding geographically and employed a full time travel coordinator on-site.

For a time, I was the leading traveler, earning some envious comments from my colleagues,

>“stop draining our travel budget, leave some for us…”

The company was expecting me to best represent them and was generously offering a pleasant accommodations to overcome the inevitable jet-lag.

A fact that should not make me any more or less than who I am

## Perception of Value

Like Ronins (浪人) of the past, when companies no longer expand, corporate travel warriors are no longer in demand.

>Has one's value have changed or diminished?  
>Or is it that the organization focus has shifted?

Inevitable changes have resulted in less traveling and so has my role in corporations.

Any roles outside of the family will fade and declines over time.

Now I am spending more time with my family.
Thus I am more vulnerable to judgements.

>What am I being judged on?

Practical skills like cooking, cleaning, and tending to kids.
Much greater responsibility and visibility, less recognition and far less tangible reward – based on the world’s measurement.

## Rewarded according to the skills in demand.

Families need certain skills and service and your presence.
However, the timing of these needs cannot be predicted nor planned.

Presence and ability and willingness to provide that service may suffice.
And in some cases, when one is not around, they will seek that service elsewhere

You are evaluated constantly on your presence and enthusiasm.

In the end, individuals that comprise the family are far more perceptive.
They do not give out grades or salaries.

Evaluation is far more fair and equitable.

Families and its members become what you spend time doing and building

## Epilogue

I understand my role better.

Also what is a timely role versus timeless role.

Sometimes one can get the those 2 mixed up and expect one to be always available even after an extended time away.

Enticing and somewhat enjoyable were those times away from the family.  
Grateful that I have had a home and a family to return to.

I welcome and am willing to take that mat on the floor at home over any fancy accommodations at a ground level or at 37,000 feet in the air.

Thank you family members for reminding me that I have a role and what your expectations are.

In turn, that expectation is the reflection of my worth as a person and as I walk and work among people of this society.

>What is your standing in the eyes of your peers?

Invite some families and friends to your home.
Or arrange a travel to family and friends.

Let me know how firm your mattress or the bedding on the ground level is.
