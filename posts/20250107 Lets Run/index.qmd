Not the greatest verbal communicator

Sister K and I use passcode once in a while.

Depending on her mood she responds with

-   No expression just a smile.
-   Go ahead, have fun and comeback soon
-   OK, let's go together. Where to?

The passcode is 도망가자

It is a way for us to communicate how our day is going.

Finally made transition to face reality

Manager during expat years, his go to phrase was. Things aren't as bad as it seems nor is it as good as it seems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learned about the TOC via the book The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt. Maximize bottleneck.

-   **Identify the Constraint**: Determine the system's bottleneck.
-   **Exploit the Constraint**: Maximize the throughput of the bottleneck without significant investment.
-   **Subordinate Everything Else**: Align all other processes to support the constraint.
-   **Elevate the Constraint**: Increase the capacity of the constraint if needed.
-   **Repeat the Process**: Once a constraint is resolved, another will emerge—continue improvement.
