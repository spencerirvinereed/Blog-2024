\

I live close to a location with both a nondescript and a pedestrian name.

That aptly named place was accessible for nearly 40 years.

\

During those years, it was like a National Park hours away, for I visited it once a year or less.

\

I rediscovered it recently.

\

For most of those years, I was commuting to Salt Lake Valley - over a 30-mile commute.

A change in job to a Utah Valley location meant the commuting time spent in cars or trains/buses can be replaced by a number of activities.

\

I followed a suggestion on a website.

\

The canyon…draws thou­sands of peo­ple annu­ally who seek recre­ation, renewal, and inspi­ra­tion. It is one of the few remaining "URBAN FORESTS" in the United States

\

Few times that I hiked the area, I was not impressed.

Aside from a few geological features, the trail was unremarkable.

I usually went after the sun had risen, during the summer months.

\

Afterwards, I concluded that an hour or two spent in the canyon or the forest was not worth it.

\

Then I switched the hiking hours so that I could visit the area in the morning and still be at work

That meant an adjustment to the sleeping schedule.

\

The early morning hours highlighted peaks, fauna, and flora that I hadn’t noticed before.

As I began to notice the small changes in the surroundings, I began to track not only sunrise and sunset information but also moonrise and moonset data.

\

It was almost like being transported to a different location in a time capsule – and back invigorated.

\

Those trips offered visual and aural as well as tactile experiences

\

The time spent in that capsule filters and clears my thoughts.

It allows me to forget things I should not hold onto.

Lightens my mind and my burden.

\

I have experienced some of the more established, crowd-inviting locations with more exotic offerings.

But it was nearly impossible to experience the offerings during the peak visiting hours with all the other guests.

\

I have to agree with Mark Twain.

I didn’t realize I lived next door to a National Park called Rock Canyon.

\

"When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years."--Mark Twain

\

chose to hike

It seemed like an aptly named area with a prominent peak visible from the valley.

Didn’t pay much attention to the canyon hike.

\

\

Not where but when

\

Not only sunrise and sunset but also the time of the year makes

\

I rediscovered it recently.

\

For most of those years, I was commuting to Salt Lake.

\

Replaced the time spent in cars or trains/buses with a hike.

\

It seemed like an aptly named area with a prominent peak visible from the valley.

Didn’t pay much attention to the canyon hike.

\

There was no water running a few times when I hiked it.

\

The place transforms itself.

Not only seasons of the year but also during time of the day.

\

Rock Canyon, adjacent to Provo, Utah, draws thou­sands of peo­ple annu­ally who seek **recre­ation, renewal, and inspi­ra­tion.** It is one of the few remaining **"URBAN FORESTS"** in the United States

\

Tracked not only sunrise and sunset but also moonrise and moonset.

\

For all those who hike up there are those that are those that are on their way down.

\

For those that hike, there are those that run.

For everyone that runs, are there ones that fly?

\

There are certainly more well established and advertised, with more exotic destinations.

For me, Rock Canyon is that and more since it is accessible, renews itself, and inspirational.

\

Filters and clears my thoughts.

Had inspiration but also let me forget things I should not hold onto.

Lightens my mind and burden.

Paralyzed by aggregated, possible or inflated RPNs

RPNs independent variables or can it happen simultaneously.

\

It seems that the news is disproportionately negative.

What happens in the vast majority of lives is no longer newsworthy.

Very few individuals both in private and public institutions, dominate and control the topic, scope, and flow of information.

\

My parents did Not relied on analysis when making decisions or how they should live their lives

They relied on their experiences, their god-given capacity to decide

\

Perceived crisis

\

Y2K, impending doom

Be aware of catchy names,slogans and campaigns.

Spells trouble if a name is created, since it is that vessel that can accommodate every and all related or non-related phenomenon.

\

The perpetrators are not punished.

Reward the guilty and punish the innocent.

\

Difficult to listen to news filled with various degrees of crisis, threat based on projections by experts.

\

Instead of RPN, as Christians, we have the FHC index.

Faith, Hope and Charity.

The fortification of these 3, comes from within, from one another, and from above

\

As I was ending my 4 year ExPat assignment the manager told me

\

Don’t go looking for opportunities they will come looking for you

\

Unfortunately, things didn’t happen like he predicted and I had to look for and apply for opportunities since those words were spoken 20 years ago.

\

However, I think I understand the intent of his message.

You have done something significant for you.

\

 in you career, people know it and they will come .

\

People are good at spotting talent

\

If I didn’t get noticed and people didn’t come for me, would I be a different person.

\

Close to my home is Rock Canyon

\

Better than a National Park, it is my personal park, a place of momentary refuge and place of inspiration.

\

I always didn’t appreciate it.

I went there too late in the day.

The park changes not only through seasons but also throughout the day.

.Lao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and the founder of Taoism. His teachings revolve around the concept of Tao, which can be translated as "The Way" or "The Way of Nature." Here are some key ideas from Lao Tzu's teachings:

\

1\. Tao: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the Tao, the natural and universal principle that underlies everything in existence. The Tao is seen as an impersonal force that cannot be fully understood or described but can be experienced.

\

2\. Wu-wei: Lao Tzu advocated for the principle of Wu-wei, which can be translated as "non-action" or "effortless action." It involves aligning oneself with the natural flow of the Tao and acting without unnecessary force or resistance. It is about allowing things to unfold naturally rather than trying to control or manipulate them.

\

3\. Simplicity and Spontaneity: Lao Tzu emphasized the value of simplicity and spontaneity in life. He believed that by letting go of desires, attachments, and excessive ambition, one can achieve inner peace and harmony. By embracing simplicity and being in tune with the natural rhythms of life, one can live a more fulfilling existence.

\

4\. Humility and Detachment: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of humility and detachment. He encouraged individuals to let go of ego and the need for recognition, and instead cultivate a sense of modesty and detachment from material possessions and social status. By doing so, one can attain true wisdom and freedom.

\

5\. Paradoxical Thinking: Lao Tzu often employed paradoxical statements to challenge conventional wisdom and encourage deeper reflection. He believed that reality is multifaceted and cannot be fully grasped through dualistic thinking. By embracing paradoxes and transcending binary concepts, individuals can gain a more profound understanding of the nature of existence.

\

Overall, Lao Tzu's teachings revolve around living in harmony with the natural order, embracing simplicity, acting without force, and cultivating humility and detachment. His philosophy encourages individuals to let go of unnecessary desires and attachments in order to achieve inner peace and align themselves with the profound wisdom of the Tao.

Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that originated in ancient India and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. The teachings of Buddhism, often referred to as the Dharma, offer guidance on how to live a meaningful and enlightened life. Here are some key teachings of Buddhism:

\

1\. The Four Noble Truths: These are considered the foundational teachings of Buddhism. They are:

   a. Dukkha (Suffering): Life is characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence.

   b. Samudaya (Origin of Suffering): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.

   c. Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering): It is possible to end suffering by letting go of attachments and desires.

   d. Magga (Path to the Cessation of Suffering): The Noble Eightfold Path leads to the cessation of suffering.

\

2\. The Noble Eightfold Path: This path provides practical guidelines for living a moral, balanced, and mindful life. It consists of eight interconnected aspects:

   a. Right View: Understanding the true nature of reality and the Four Noble Truths.

   b. Right Intention: Cultivating positive intentions and letting go of harmful thoughts.

   c. Right Speech: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and avoiding harmful speech.

   d. Right Action: Acting in ways that are ethical, compassionate, and non-harming.

   e. Right Livelihood: Engaging in a profession that promotes well-being and avoids harm.

   f. Right Effort: Cultivating wholesome qualities and letting go of unwholesome ones.

   g. Right Mindfulness: Developing present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation.

   h. Right Concentration: Cultivating focused and tranquil states of mind through meditation.

\

3\. Impermanence: Buddhism emphasizes the understanding that everything in life is impermanent. All conditioned phenomena, including ourselves, are subject to change and decay. Recognizing this truth helps us let go of attachments and reduces suffering.

\

4\. No-Self (Anatta): Buddhism teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. Instead, our existence is characterized by a constantly changing flow of physical and mental processes. Understanding the absence of a fixed self leads to a more liberated and interconnected view of reality.

\

5\. Compassion and Loving-kindness: Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings. This includes developing empathy, extending goodwill, and working towards alleviating the suffering of others.

\

6\. Mindfulness and Meditation: Buddhism places great emphasis on the practice of mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of one's thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Meditation cultivates concentration, insight, and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.

\

7\. Karma and Rebirth: Buddhism teaches the concept of karma, which states that our intentional actions have consequences. Positive actions lead to positive outcomes, while negative actions lead to suffering. Buddhism also holds the belief in rebirth, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth until one achieves enlightenment and liberation from this cycle.

\

These teachings of Buddhism provide a comprehensive framework for individuals to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and inner peace while navigating the challenges of existence. Buddhism encourages personal inquiry, self-reflection, and the development of ethical behavior and mental well-being.

\

6\. Worship and Sacraments: Christianity emphasizes communal worship and the gathering of believers. Worship practices vary across different Christian traditions but often involve prayer, singing hymns, reading scripture, preaching, and participating in sacraments. Sacraments, such as baptism and the Eucharist (also known as Communion or the Lord's Supper), are considered sacred rituals that convey spiritual grace.

\

7\. Resurrection and Eternal Life: Christianity teaches the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which signifies victory over sin and death.

Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence (ahimsa), truth (satya), non-attachment (aparigraha), and compassion (karuna). It was founded by spiritual leaders known as Tirthankaras, the most notable being Lord Mahavira. Here are some key teachings of Jainism:

\

1\. Non-violence (Ahimsa): Ahimsa is the core principle of Jainism. Jains believe in the absolute sanctity of all life forms and practice non-violence in thought, speech, and action. This includes refraining from causing harm to any living being intentionally and promoting peace and harmony.

\

2\. Non-attachment (Aparigraha): Aparigraha teaches the virtue of non-attachment and detachment from material possessions. Jains aim to minimize their desires and possessions, recognizing that excessive attachment can lead to suffering and hinder spiritual progress.

\

3\. Truthfulness (Satya): Satya emphasizes the importance of truthfulness and honesty in all aspects of life. Jains strive to speak the truth, avoid falsehood, and promote transparency and sincerity.

\

4\. Non-stealing (Asteya): Jains adhere to the principle of non-stealing, which extends beyond physical possessions to include not taking what is not freely given, such as others' ideas, time, or resources. Respect for others' property and personal boundaries is emphasized.

\

5\. Right Conduct (Samyak Charitra): Jainism emphasizes the practice of right conduct, which involves following a set of ethical guidelines to lead a virtuous life. This includes refraining from violence, dishonesty, stealing, sensual indulgence, and greed.

\

6\. Karma and Reincarnation: Jainism teaches the concept of karma, the law of cause and effect. It states that every action, whether physical, verbal, or mental, generates karma that affects one's present and future lives. Jains believe in the cycle of birth and rebirth, and seek to break free from this cycle through spiritual purification.

\

7\. Multiple Perspectives (Anekantavada): Anekantavada is the principle of multiple perspectives and non-absolutism. It encourages Jains to embrace the idea that truth is multi-dimensional and can be perceived differently by different individuals. It promotes tolerance, open-mindedness, and respect for diverse viewpoints.

\

8\. Asceticism and Self-discipline: Jainism upholds the value of self-discipline and austerity as means to attain spiritual purity and liberation. Some Jains, particularly monks and nuns, adopt an ascetic lifestyle, practicing rigorous self-control, simplicity, and renunciation of worldly desires.

\

9\. Compassion and Service (Karuna): Jains emphasize compassion and kindness towards all living beings. They believe in actively practicing compassion by engaging in acts of service, helping those in need, and promoting the welfare and well-being of others.

\

Jainism is a complex and comprehensive spiritual path with various philosophical and ethical principles. These teachings guide Jains in their pursuit of liberation (moksha) and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment by living a life of non-violence, truth, non-attachment, and compassion.

Zoroastrianism, also known as Zarathustra's Teachings, is one of the world's oldest known monotheistic religions. It was founded by the Persian prophet Zarathustra (Zoroaster) in ancient Iran around the 6th century BCE. Here are some key teachings of Zoroastrianism:

\

1\. Monotheism: Zoroastrianism is centered around the belief in one supreme God, Ahura Mazda, who is the creator of the universe, all-knowing, and all-powerful. Ahura Mazda represents goodness, truth, and righteousness.

\

2\. Dualistic Cosmology: Zoroastrianism teaches a dualistic worldview. It emphasizes the ongoing cosmic struggle between the forces of good and evil.

Human beings are seen as active participants in this cosmic battle, with the freedom to choose between good and evil.

\

3\. Ethical Principles: Zoroastrianism places a strong emphasis on ethical living and moral choices. The religion promotes the practice of Asha, which encompasses truth, righteousness, order, and justice. Zoroastrians are encouraged to live virtuous lives, engage in honest and fair dealings, and promote social harmony and the well-being of others.

\

\

5\. Frashokereti (Final Renovation): Zoroastrianism teaches the belief in the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Frashokereti refers to the final renovation or the ultimate restoration of the world to its original state of perfection. It is believed that at the end of time, a savior figure called Saoshyant will appear and bring about a spiritual and physical resurrection, where the righteous will be rewarded and the evil will be punished.

\

6\. Sacred Texts: The primary religious texts of Zoroastrianism are the Avesta and the Gathas. The Avesta contains hymns, prayers, rituals, and teachings, while the Gathas are a collection of hymns composed by Zarathustra himself. These texts provide guidance on ethics, rituals, and spiritual practices.

\

7\. Rituals and Worship: Zoroastrian worship involves prayers, recitation of sacred texts, and rituals performed in the presence of fire. Zoroastrians also engage in regular acts of charity, which are considered important for spiritual growth.

\

8\. Environmental Stewardship: Zoroastrianism places emphasis on environmental stewardship and the protection of nature. The religion encourages respect for the natural world and responsible care for the environment.

\

Zoroastrianism has significantly influenced other major religions and philosophies, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Its teachings continue to be followed by a small but dedicated community of Zoroastrians today.

Manichaeism was a major religious movement that emerged in the 3rd century CE and was founded by the prophet Mani. It incorporated elements from various religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Gnosticism. Here are some key teachings of Manichaeism:

\

1\. Dualistic Cosmology: Manichaeism presents a dualistic worldview in which the universe is seen as a battleground between the forces of light and darkness.

Below the Father of Greatness are other divine beings, including the Primal Man and the Living Jesus. These beings are seen as emanations of light.

\

3\. Cosmic Battle: Manichaeism teaches that the forces of light and darkness are engaged in an eternal struggle. The goal of the forces of light is to liberate the divine sparks trapped within the material world and return them to the realm of light. This battle is reflected in the struggle between good and evil in the human soul.

\

4\. Human Soul: According to Manichaeism, human souls are composed of both light and darkness. The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the divine sparks within the soul by rejecting the material world and embracing the spiritual realm of light.

\

\

6\. Reincarnation: Manichaeism teaches the belief in reincarnation. The soul is seen as trapped in a cycle of rebirth until it achieves liberation from the material world and reunites with the realm of light.

\

7\. Rituals and Worship: Manichaeism had various rituals and practices, including baptism, prayer, and the recitation of sacred texts. Rituals were often performed in designated sacred spaces.

\

8\. Cosmic Redemption: Manichaeism teaches that through the efforts of the Living Jesus, divine sparks will eventually be freed from the material world, leading to the ultimate victory of light over darkness and the restoration of the spiritual realm.

\

Manichaeism had a significant impact on the religious landscape of its time, but it faced persecution and declined in influence over the centuries. Today, it is considered an extinct religion, with only fragments of its teachings and scriptures surviving.
