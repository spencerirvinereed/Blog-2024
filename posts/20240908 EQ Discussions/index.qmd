## Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples

The story of ark as a representation of a temple.
`Reed` Walls is like the veil.
Ark came to rest on the top of the mountain.
Dimensions of arks are representing the temple.

Highest levels of temples (ark) as the presence of God.

Moses tried to usher the people into the presence of God

24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.

D&C 84

Representations of temples are everywhere around us.
But hidden from the world.
For they are spirtually discerned
In the **Epic of Gilgamesh**, **Utnapishtim** plays a critical role as a character who possesses the secret to immortality. His encounter with the hero, Gilgamesh, marks a pivotal moment in the story, as Gilgamesh's quest for eternal life reaches its climax. Here’s a breakdown of Utnapishtim’s role in the epic:

### 1. **The Survivor of the Great Flood**

-   Utnapishtim is most famous for surviving a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity. His story bears significant resemblance to the biblical account of Noah’s Ark in the Book of Genesis.
-   He was warned by the god **Ea (Enki)** about the impending flood and instructed to build a massive boat to save himself, his family, and the animals.
-   After the flood, Utnapishtim and his wife were granted immortality by the gods as a reward for preserving life and obeying their command.

### 2. **Symbol of Immortality**

-   Gilgamesh seeks out Utnapishtim after the death of his friend **Enkidu**, driven by a fear of death and a desire to discover the secret of eternal life.
-   Utnapishtim represents the possibility of immortality, something that Gilgamesh believes he can attain.
-   However, Utnapishtim’s story ultimately shows that immortality is not meant for mortals. While he and his wife were granted eternal life, this was an exception and not something Gilgamesh can achieve through effort or desire.

### 3. **The Test of Endurance**

-   When Gilgamesh meets Utnapishtim, he pleads for the secret to eternal life. Instead of directly giving it to him, Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s endurance by challenging him to stay awake for six days and seven nights.
-   Gilgamesh fails the test, falling asleep almost immediately, which underscores the frailty and limitations of human beings. Utnapishtim demonstrates that if Gilgamesh cannot conquer something as simple as sleep, he is unworthy of immortality.

### 4. **The Plant of Youth**

-   Despite Gilgamesh’s failure, Utnapishtim shows some compassion and reveals the existence of a plant at the bottom of the ocean that can restore youth.
-   Gilgamesh successfully retrieves the plant, but on his way back to his city, **a serpent steals it**, and Gilgamesh loses the chance for renewed youth. This event highlights the theme of inevitable mortality and the elusiveness of eternal life.

### 5. **Philosophical Message**

-   Utnapishtim’s role is crucial in conveying one of the central themes of the Epic of Gilgamesh: **the inevitability of death** and the importance of living a full and meaningful life.
-   He helps Gilgamesh realize that instead of seeking immortality, he should focus on the legacy he leaves behind and the life he leads on Earth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Summary of Utnapishtim's Role:

-   **Survivor of the Flood**: He provides the key mythological story about a great flood and the gods' decision to grant him immortality.
-   **Test of Gilgamesh**: Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh's ability to transcend mortal limitations, which Gilgamesh fails.
-   **Lesson in Mortality**: He teaches Gilgamesh that immortality is reserved for the gods and special circumstances, and that human beings must come to terms with death.
-   **Conveys the Epic's Theme**: Utnapishtim helps shift Gilgamesh’s quest from a search for eternal life to a recognition of the need to live meaningfully.
