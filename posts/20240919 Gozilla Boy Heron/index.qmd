Seldom write about today’s movies since I rarely see them
Normally only movies I see in theaters are those paid for by the company for company activities.

This week I paid for and watched 2 movies in person.

One was animation, latest in a Miyazaki series.
The other was the “new” original released nearly 70 years ago, directed by Yamazaki

Instead of story line that is not believable
We even get characters that we can relate
With issues

Imperfect world with disasters.
No heroes to solve it, but their own ingenuity.


Did I enjoy it.
I loved it

There was a story in both movies.
Some action but not overwhelming the story

Something that one can relate to 

—
Parent child relationship

—
Not what environment or circumstance has done to you but what will you do to defend and conquer one’s enemy whether internal or external
Overcame london bombing

Christmas day speech
