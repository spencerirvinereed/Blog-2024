I witnessed something recently that surprised me.

A singer made a mistake during a live performance and the production company decided to release the footage.

宇多田ヒカル, the singer who sang - `First Love`, was singing `I LOVE YOU` (Originally sung by 尾崎 豊 Ozaki Yutaka).

About a minute into the song, she made a mistake.

Up to that point, she was pushing her voice to the breaking point.

It was a live performance, afterall.

This made her more human and likable.

She apologized, regrouped, and within a minute, she began from the beginning.

Meanwhile, the audience was applauding, encouraging her.

She finished the song the 2nd time.

Less vibration in her voice, more settled.

Making the mistake settled her down it seemed.

Human elements and talents are elevated because of imperfections and vulnerability.

It was refreshing to hear the performer with a unique approach to a familiar song.

Not trying to repeat but creating a new version of the song.

Today and in the future, there is worry about AI in music and elsewhere where creativity and individuality is crucial..

Not worried as long as we have brave souls that create songs and those who cover those songs.

Mistake and all.

Perhaps equally important, audience that expect errors and embrace and encourage it.
