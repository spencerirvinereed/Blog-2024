My father loved to visit places.

My mother did not.

This was a quandary for most of their married life.

Until their grandchildren arrived.

In their latter life, they both enjoyed travel to nearby and far places, especially when accompanied by their grandchildren.

I now understand better my parent's view on traveling or vacationing

For my father, the traveling represented a time away from responsibilities, see and learn new things, and taste new dishes.

Meanwhile, my mother recognized that tasks and chores do not take breaks and will still be around after the break.

But once out of the home, she was more enthusiastic about the new place and new tastes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When my father was 71 and my mother 69 we visited parts of Europe as a family. We worried that they would slow down the group.

There was no need for that.

We thoroughly enjoyed visiting sites associated with the birth and flourishing of Western Civilization

One thing we couldn't arrange was return to their 고향 (故鄕).

The Korean Wikipedia has three definitions.

-   the place of birth and growing up
-   the place where your ancestors lived for generations
-   that place you miss and cherish deep in your heart.

My mother and father knew exactly the place of their birth and childhood home. If the borders were abolished, I think they could lead a group of visitors right up to the neighborhood.

I imagine, they could have done that even in their 80s.

A few years after the European visit, we got to visit 백령도 (白翎島). An island, about 200 kilometers from Incheon Airport, or a 4-hour ferry ride. The island is inhabited by 5000 persons, including Mom's cousin on her mother's side.

When we arrived on the island. I didn't need an introduction, I was instantly accepted as a family, by virtue of being my mom's son. My 2 sons were automatically recognized as an extended family. 

This was a rare and memorable welcoming for me as a son of refugees from the Northern Korea.

Mom's cousin and his wife provided a feast and took us around the island. The island is roughly 50 square kilometers or 1/15 of Singapore.

Many of its residents are from nearby counties in North Korea. Some of these are less than 10 miles from the coast of 백령도 (白翎島).

They came to the island in a temporary arrangement. They were to return, once the conflict was resolved.\

That was nearly 74 years ago.

I don't know whether I will step foot on North Korea.

Even if I did, who would guide me to our family's hometown. 

And then if we did meet the extended family, what would the conversation consist of.

Nevertheless, I hope to fulfill the wishes of my parents and visit those places and say.

> "I am home (ただいま)"

and they will respond,

> 'Welcome Home"

ただいま帰りました (Tadaima kaerimashita)

> I have returned, indeed.
