An option on the Robo Taxi that I would like to see.

A programmable driver with the language of your choice.

Based on my travel days, taxi cab drivers can be the mobile philosophers, if you ask the right questions.

Some comments

-   your hearing is more 간사(奸詐, deceitful) than eyes. He was an audiophile

-   your pronunciation is way too high, please speak with a lower tone.

-   we don't leave this open air zoo because this is where our lives are supported.

The last comment was from a driver at a city-state nation.

Except for a time in Korea, I would have talk to more to drivers, but often language was the issue.

What kept that driver in the Zoo.

What risks to success, freedom to fail.
