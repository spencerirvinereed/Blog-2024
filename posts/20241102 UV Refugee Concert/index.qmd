Attended a concert given by students and teachers.

The program was printed in 3 languages, Spanish, English, and Ukrainian

These students were refugees speaking those languages.

The performance covered the range of beginners to intermediate learners, and I thought of my beginnings in this country.

I was a remediation student, a deficient learner, a project, when it came to understanding English.

2 special teachers and a number of volunteers helped me during the first year[^1] at Springhill Elementary School.

[^1]: one was Bishop's wife, Sister Pearl Johnson, I later learned

I also remember Suzanne Li, who must have been a student intern. She helped me during her internship and afterwards with encouraging letters. Those meant much then, as they do now.

I made good progress, and by the 2nd year, I had sufficient comprehension that those special courses were not needed.

Due to all these attention and care, I was prepared to embark on a life as a first generation immigrant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking back those were some trying days, but we expected difficult days as economic refugees.

Also compared to my parents who were the true first generation immigrants, my life was not difficult at all.

Watching my parents toil without murmuring set the stage for our family to be established both economically and spiritually in this land.

Thanks to teachers, volunteers, employers, congregation members that helped us settle in this country many decades ago.

As Sister K and I made home in a light drizzle, after the concert.

We discussed how challenging life is for the rising generation.

Will they have all of the opportunities and a chance to own physical manifestations.

Then our thoughts reverted back to the message and resolve of those refugee participants.

We are not currently in or likely be facing uncertainties or decisions that involve threats to our lives or freedom.

It is written in the Book of Mormon and spoken by prophets^[<https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1976/04/if-they-will-but-serve-the-god-of-the-land?lang=eng>],

> “And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations.” (1 Ne. 13:18–19.)

Thank you brave souls that continue to arrive in this land of opportunity and embrace the opportunity to serve the God of this land and over all of the earth.

> “Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.” (Ether 2:12)
