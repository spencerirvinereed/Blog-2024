I am selfish, at times.

Some days, I feel well enough to go through this life on my own.

Often, I need the strength of those around me and those that have gone ahead of me.

At times their presence feels close and that is sufficient

Then there are those moments that I want to feel and hear their reply.

I want to hear and feel their strength, more than ever.

Have them explain and confirm to me the ultimate worth of a person, not influenced or to the standard of the world. Given by the persons who knew me best and cared most â€“ my parents.

Once more, I want to hear their stories of how they survived the war, the poverty.

How they strengthened their testimony in uncertain times

I want to feel their unconditional love once more.

But I am not able to know or feel their response to my request.

Much like how I feel the influence of the spirit, I know they are nearby and listening.

Instead, I will direct my yearning for them towards the young people of the next generation.

I will love them as individuals as they did.

I will reinforce their worth, assuredly and repeatedly.

I will bear witness that overcoming poverty and trials is part of this life.

For overcoming them with help of loved ones; near, in this life and far, in another domain, is the essence of earthly sojourn

I will still reach out to them.

For I want them to know that they are thought of and loved.

And if possible, I want them to respond with a tangible display of acknowledgement.

Thank you Mom and Dad.

I will talk about how we grew up in poverty.

How we
