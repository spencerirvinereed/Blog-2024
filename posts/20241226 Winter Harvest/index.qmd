Before the advent of refrigeration and the year round production of vegetables, the Koreans relied on preserving 김 치 to make through winter months.

Found a photo of mom, along with her neighbors, making 김치 that will last all of winter.

The process began with selecting cabbages from wholesalers.

At the time, we lived in 주안 and the supplies for 김치 was not fully available. Mom arranged 배추 to be delivered to the home.

Then cabbages would be delivered using 리어카(RearCar/リヤカー).

[I followed the older man, (he looked old, but probably was not even 50) delivering cabbages home. Pushing the cart on the uphill. It was about a 5km journey, according to Google map, but for a young person, it seemed much longer.]

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Install required package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("leaflet", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("leaflet")

# Load the leaflet library
library(leaflet)

# Define the coordinates for Shibuya, Tokyo
coords <- c(lat = 37.45467381059076, lng = 126.67414638983166)

# Create the leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap tiles
  setView(lng = coords["lng"], lat = coords["lat"], zoom = 14) %>%  # Set view to Shibuya
  addMarkers(lng = coords["lng"], lat = coords["lat"], 
             popup = "인천주안초등학교")  # Add a marker with a popup

```

I estimate scores of cabbages, approaching 100 were purchased and delivered.

[It is possible, 김치 was made and divided among families]

My mom would orchestrate the production of 김치.

We shared a common wall with the elementary school. Between the wall was a space, with a protective awning of transparent plastic. My dad or his younger brother, who was living with us, must have dug a hole in the ground for the 항아리 to be buried.

These were good sized potteries. About 3 feet high with a 3 feet circumference at its peak width.  (The actual size may have been smaller, everything seemed bigger when you were young)

I recall breaking ice to access cabbages and radishes during winter months.

These provide nourishment we needed during those months when no fresh vegetables were available.

I remember the crisp, naturally preserved, flavor of radishes. Mom would slice them into size of thin french fries and and bit of vinegar and red pepper.

That was how we survived long winter months during growing up years in 인천.
