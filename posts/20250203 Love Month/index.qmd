Didn't get an e-Mail reply that I was expecting.

A colleague explained,

> Their Friday is pretty much an off day.

Then I remembered a time I worked with a vendor near Barcelona.

When we laid out the project plan for a year long effort, they blanked out the whole month of August.

How nice.

In America we should start slowly,

Perhaps, a month where every weekend is a 3 day weekend.

And we can call it the Month of Love, instead of its current name, February.

Once, while working with young people, they suggested we have a campaign.

The campaign would be held during the month of February.

We would talk about it, work on it, and encourage courtship.

As the supervising, adult leader, I was elated.

That topic was foremost in minds of leaders but we didn't want to be seen as anxious.

Of course, most of us were.

When the idea originated with the young people, it was refreshing to see their approach.

During the month, we held gatherings that involved food, music, and games.

In addition to regularly scheduled Sunday meetings.

Then on one Sunday, a representatives from the Women's leadership went to a meeting of Young Single Adult Men. And vice versa.

I stayed with the Young Single Women.

Two of the Men stood in the front of the room and matter of factedly presented the current state of courtship and ways to make it more effective and real.

I couldn't believe what was happening.

(years later, still hard to believe it actually occurred)

Then they opened up for a Q&A.

The level of questions and answers was equally unbelievable.^[The exact details escape me, but these were the prevailing feelings among members during the time we held the event]

> How do we stay focused on the gospel, while disappoints abound
>
> What are your criteria for selecting companions
>
> What are some ways that message of love can be shared

I came away from the meeting less concerned about the future.

Do we need a campaign?

Is setting aside a day of love necessary?

If necessary, why do we confine it to a single day?
