I have many questions, and I am satisfied with answers I have thus far.

The ones given by my family, especially mom and dad who demonstrated what a consecrated life is.

A religious leader defined a need, architectonic one.

> what might be called modern man’s architectonic needs—that is, our deep needs to discern some design, purpose, pattern, or plan regarding human existence.

My needs were basic.

Have enough to eat, something to wear, learn something that can support a family.

So far in this life, not only were my desires met but unexpressed dreams were fulfilled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dictionary defines architectonic as the systematic structure of our knowledge.

Growing up, I relied on the knowledge structure of my immediate family.

The strong, tight-knit, loving people of Northern Korea.

Specifically, 함경남도 and 평안남도.

They were believers when the Soviet backed regime disallowed religion.

They were the builders when all was lost during the War.

They were that generation that created the miracle of Han River.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we were poor and barely met basic needs, we always felt that there was a plan.

We were moving in the right direction with the aid of a providential force - unseen but felt.

Later, as a family, we learned about the Plan and the Role of Redeemer.

That there is a design for our existence in this life and another life afterwards.

And the purpose of this life is,

> “This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God” (Alma 34:32)

Furthermore,

> And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. (John 17:3)

**24** But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who [knoweth](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng#note24a) all things.

**25** [Adam](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng#note25a) [fell](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng#note25b) that men might be; and men [are](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng#note25c), that they might have [joy](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng#note25d).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My testimony,

Our lives are eternal and can be fulfilling as we live a life centered on Christ's teachings.

There is a plan for our happiness.

Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.
