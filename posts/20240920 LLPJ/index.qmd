Spent 9 years living in a suburban Washington DC area, Maryland.

That was the beginning of our lives in the United States.

Those years can be recalled in terms of where we lived and what school we attended.

Rather, those years were years of association with a unit known as the Carrollton Ward.

That was a great blessing for the Kang Family.

Immigrants seek a better life elsewhere

Mainly for education and economic improvement for future generations, religious liberty, asylum from persecution and family strife.

My family came for 3 out of 4 reasons.

In the end religion became the defining reason.

As an immigrant I learned how to read, write and speak in English through the Prince George’s county school system.

However, I learned how to live this life, as a follower of Christ, in a congregation of saints

## First few years of Transition

Figuring out the church schedule was a challenge, since we couldn’t understand the announcement.
We missed our share of meetings due to Stake and General Conferences and missed the starting time, due to not understanding the Daylight Savings Time.

Our language improved and Brother Bacon from Terre Haute, IN became our Home Teacher.
For the next 5 years, he faithfully visited our home.
We became more involved in the Ward

Not always, but attended the weeknight meetings as well.

That led to participating in Road Shows, summer camps and a church wide celebration.
Summer camps and Father and Sons campout were those rare occasions to see places other than a cityscape/

The Sesquicentennial celebration in Roanoke and the surrounding area in 1980 was a defining event for a young person.

The magnitude of participation, from the mid-atlantic areas, as well as the depth of commitment demonstrated by participants made a deep impression.

The Ferrum College and the surrounding areas of Roanoke Conference Center opened up a new chapter for a young immigrant person.

We attended church in Korea after the War.
For adults, it was a religion.
For a young person, it was a chore to walk to and from church often at night
Hearing wild animals added to the sense of sacrifice and an adventure.

Snacks or treats offered during Easters and Christmas were definitely highlights.

Then our family, mainly through my mother’s conversion, joined another congregation.
It was not a popular choice then.
But my mother was convinced that it was the right choice for her and the family.

Within 3 years, we were boarding a plane headed for Anchorage.
On our way to a new home in the Washington DC area.

Particularly memorable gatherings were at Christmas time.

Was asked to learn Christmas Carol to be sung at the Church.
Participated in Christmas Devotional at the Church.
My father became one of the Wisemen at a church play.

Recall a Christmas Eve gathering at a home, where people are invited to visit, stay or go according to their schedule.  Plenty of goodies were served.
Remember thinking, when I have a chance, I want to have a gathering like this.

This and many other gatherings helped me realize what a family centered, community assisted living was like.

According to Ephesians, 

> 19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;




Words when words cannot be found
Hope when things looked bleak

Now that you are on the other side.
Could you be that force that helps us.

Help us to be wise when we don’t know

25. “When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence.” 
Ansel Adams 


The silence, often of pure innocence, persuades where speaking fails.
Shakespeare 

A sage thing is timely silence, and better than any speech.

가사
남들도 모르게 서성이다 울었지
지나온 일들이 가슴에 사무쳐
텅빈 하늘 밑 불빛들 켜져가면
옛사랑 그 이름 아껴 불러보네
찬바람 불어와 옷깃을 여미우다
후회가 또 화가 나 눈물이 흐르네
누가 물어도 아플 것같지 않던
지나온 내 모습 모두 거짓인가

이제 그리운 것은 그리운대로 내 맘에 둘 거야
그대 생각이 나면 생각난대로 내버려 두듯이

흰눈 나리면 들판에 서성이다
옛사랑 생각에 그 길 찾아가지
광화문거리 흰눈에 덮혀가고
하얀눈 하늘 높이 자꾸 올라가네

이제 그리운 것은 그리운대로 내 맘에 둘 거야
그대 생각이 나면 생각난대로 내버려 두듯이

사랑이란 게 지겨울 때가 있지
내 맘에 고독이 너무 흘러넘쳐
눈 녹은 봄날 푸르른 잎새 위에
옛사랑 그대 모습 영원 속에 있네

흰눈 나리면 들판에 서성이다
옛사랑 생각에 그 길 찾아가지
광화문거리 흰눈에 덮혀가고
하얀눈 하늘높이 자꾸 올라가네

I cried while wandering around without others noticing.
Things that have happened are deep in my heart
When the lights turn on under the empty sky
I call out the name of my old love with care
A cold wind blows and frays my collar.
I feel regretful and angry again, tears are flowing.
It didn't seem like it would hurt no matter who asked
Are all of my past lies a lie?

Now, I will keep the things I miss in my heart as I miss them.
When I think of you, I leave it alone

When white snow falls, I wander in the fields.
I think about my old love and find that path.
Gwanghwamun Street is covered in white snow
The white snow keeps rising high into the sky

Now, I will keep the things I miss in my heart as I miss them.
When I think of you, I leave it alone

There are times when love is boring
My heart is overflowing with loneliness
On the green leaves of a spring day when the snow melts
Old love, you are in eternity

When white snow falls, I wander in the fields.
I think about my old love and find that path.
Gwanghwamun Street is covered in white snow
The white snow keeps rising high into the sky


Here is the English translation of the Korean lyrics:

Without others knowing, I lingered and cried
The past events haunt my heart
Under the empty sky, as the lights come on
I call the name of the old love, cherishing it
The cold wind blows, brushing against my clothes
Regret rises again, anger surfaces, and tears flow
No matter who asks, it didn't seem painful
Is the person I used to be all a lie?

Now, what I miss will remain in my heart as it is
When thoughts of you come, I'll let them be as they come

If it snows, I wander in the field
Thinking of the old love, finding that path
Gwanghwamun Street covered in white snow
The white snow keeps rising high into the sky

Now, what I miss will remain in my heart as it is
When thoughts of you come, I'll let them be as they come

Love can be tiresome at times
Loneliness overflows in my heart
On a spring day with melted snow, on fresh green leaves
The figure of the old love remains eternally

If it snows, I wander in the field
Thinking of the old love, finding that path
Gwanghwamun Street covered in white snow
The white snow keeps rising high into the sky
