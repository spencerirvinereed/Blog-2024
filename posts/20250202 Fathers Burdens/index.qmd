Being Korean used to be much more complicated.

Multiple religions, languages, and traditions coexisted in a country of 40 million persons.

I am happy that some of these traditions have yielded to a modern ones.

한국나이 counts age according to number of years one has partcipated.

If you are born in 1999, in any part of that year, you would turn 2 on the year 2000.

Since you were alive for 2 calendar years, 1999 and 2000.

In some circles, they counted the months one spent in embryos as well, further complicating the matter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful not to get rid of unique and endearing traditions that separate Korea as a nation and people.
