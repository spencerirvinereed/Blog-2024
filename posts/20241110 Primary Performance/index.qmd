Yearly Primary Program.

Out of mouth of babes come the truth

Many families and kingdoms in progress.

Not a group but individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greater impact on humanity than a football or basketball match.

Things I need for life eternal, or All things I learned in Primary or Kindergarten

Not sure if children's performance has improved or my appreciation has increased.

One thing has been a decrease in number and more diversity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the years past, I would spend time reading about candidates and what experts said about current and future likely outcome, if certain individuals were elected.

At other times, I would devote myself to watching and re-watching a sporting event that I had no part.

Other than that I had lived in the city or attend the school to get a degree.

In some cases the 2nd generation of players that I had followed are playing.

Why did I spend my time time and emotional energy whether a team won or lost?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a short 45 minutes, learned more about our purpose in this life.

God has a plan for me
