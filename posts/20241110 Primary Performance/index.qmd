Yearly Primary Program.

Out of mouth of babes come the truth

Many families and kingdoms in progress.

Not a group but individuals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greater impact on humanity than a football or basketball match.

Things I need for life eternal, or All things I learned in Primary or Kindergarten

Not sure if children's performance has improved or my appreciation has increased.

One thing has been a decrease in number and more diversity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the years past, I would spend time reading about candidates and what experts said about current and future likely outcome, if certain individuals were elected.

At other times, I would devote myself to watching and re-watching a sporting event that I had no part.

Other than that I had lived in the city or attend the school to get a degree.

In some cases the 2nd generation of players that I had followed are playing.

Why did I spend my time time and emotional energy whether a team won or lost?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a short 45 minutes, learned more about our purpose in this life.

God has a plan for me

During the week, we had the most consequential decision of our time.

For those in the state of Utah, we also had the first rendition of the "Holy War" as a major conference.

A group that will lead during the mid-century performed.

This performance beat both of those.

Truth out of mouth of babes

Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. Psalm 8:2

Matthew 21:16

^**16**^ And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

Kingdom of Heaven is like these children

^**2**^ And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,

^**3**^ And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

^**4**^ Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

Matthew 18:2-4
