## 天若有情 (A Moment of Romance)

was released in Korea as

## 天長地久 (Forever)

[1990년](https://namu.wiki/w/1990%EB%85%84 "1990년") [홍콩 영화](https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%99%8D%EC%BD%A9%20%EC%98%81%ED%99%94 "홍콩 영화"). 감독은 진목승. 출연은 [유덕화](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9C%A0%EB%8D%95%ED%99%94 "유덕화"), 오천련, [오맹달](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%98%A4%EB%A7%B9%EB%8B%AC "오맹달"), 황광량.\
\
원제는 '천약유정(天若有情)'. [당나라](https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%8B%B9%EB%82%98%EB%9D%BC "당나라") 시인 [이하](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%B4%ED%95%98(%EC%8B%9C%EC%9D%B8) "이하(시인)")(李賀, 791\~817)의 시에서 유래했다.[\[1\]](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%B2%9C%EC%9E%A5%EC%A7%80%EA%B5%AC#fn-1) 국내 개봉 타이틀인 '천장지구(天長地久)'는 '하늘과 땅이 오래도록 변치 않다'는 뜻으로 『[노자](https://namu.wiki/w/%EB%85%B8%EC%9E%90 "노자")』 제7장에 나오는 구절이다.[#참고](http://lifendeath.tistory.com/463 "http://lifendeath.tistory.com/463"). 원제를 생각하면 도덕경보다는 [장한가](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9E%A5%ED%95%9C%EA%B0%80 "장한가")의 마지막 구절 "天長地久有時盡 此恨綿綿無絶期"에서 따왔을 가능성이 더 크다. '천장(天長)'과 '지구(地久)'는 [일본 제국](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%9D%BC%EB%B3%B8%20%EC%A0%9C%EA%B5%AD "일본 제국")의 [절일](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%A0%88%EC%9D%BC#s-3.2.1 "절일") 칭호로 쓰이기도 했다.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the full text of **《金铜仙人辞汉歌》** (*Song of the Bronze Immortal’s Farewell to the Han*) by **Li He (李贺)**:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **金铜仙人辞汉歌**

**唐 · 李贺**

茂陵刘郎秋风客，\

夜闻马嘶晓无迹。\

画栏桂树悬秋香，\

三十六宫土花碧。

魏官牵车指千里，\

东关酸风射眸子。\

宫女如花满春殿，\

只今惟有鹧鸪飞。

天若有情天亦老，\

月如无恨月长圆。

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Translation & Meaning**

#### **1. The Fall of Han and Nostalgia for the Past**

> **茂陵刘郎秋风客，**\
>
> **夜闻马嘶晓无迹。**\
>
> *(The nobleman of Maoling, a guest in the autumn wind,*\
>
> *Hears the neighing of horses at night, but by dawn, they leave no trace.)*

-   

-   "Maoling" refers to the tomb of **Emperor Wu of Han**, a symbol of the dynasty’s former greatness.

-   

-   "Liu Lang" (刘郎) is a poetic reference to a **Han prince or descendant**, possibly a figure representing the **ghost of the dynasty**, lamenting its decline.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **2. Fading Beauty of the Palace**

> **画栏桂树悬秋香，**\
>
> **三十六宫土花碧。**\
>
> *(Painted railings, osmanthus trees hang with autumn fragrance,*\
>
> *Thirty-six palaces now covered in green moss and dust.)*

-   

-   The once glorious palaces are now **abandoned**, overtaken by nature.

-   

-   The **"thirty-six palaces"** symbolize the grandeur of the Han court, now reduced to ruins.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3. The Bronze Immortal’s Journey & Desolation**

> **魏官牵车指千里，**\
>
> **东关酸风射眸子。**\
>
> *(Officials of Wei drag the cart a thousand miles away,*\
>
> *At the Eastern Gate, the bitter wind stings the eyes.)*

-   

-   The **Bronze Immortal Statue** is being moved from the Han capital (Chang’an) under the rule of Wei.

-   

-   The phrase **"酸风射眸子"** (bitter wind stings the eyes) conveys deep sorrow and loss.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **4. Vanishing Courtly Life**

> **宫女如花满春殿，**\
>
> **只今惟有鹧鸪飞。**\
>
> *(Once, palace ladies bloomed like flowers in spring halls,*\
>
> *Now, only partridges fly there.)*

-   

-   The **contrast between the past and present**: once, the palace was full of life; now, it is empty.

-   

-   The **partridge (鹧鸪)**, often a symbol of longing and sadness, replaces the once-lavish court life.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **5. The Famous Lines: Time’s Indifference to Suffering**

> **天若有情天亦老，**\
>
> **月如无恨月长圆。**\
>
> *(If heaven had emotions, even it would grow old;*\
>
> *If the moon had no regrets, it would always remain full.)*

-   

-   A **philosophical reflection**: **the universe is indifferent to human sorrow**—only people suffer from loss and aging.

-   

-   A **contrast between emotion and nature**: heaven and the moon remain unaffected by history’s tragedies.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Conclusion & Legacy**

This poem **mourns the passage of time, the fall of great dynasties, and the impermanence of human glory**. The **Bronze Immortal** becomes a symbol of **lost power, nostalgia, and the cruelty of time**.

Would you like a deeper analysis of the poem’s literary techniques or historical context? 😊

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **In-Depth Analysis of 《金铜仙人辞汉歌》 by 李贺**

Li He (李贺) was a Tang Dynasty poet known for his **melancholic, imaginative, and historically reflective poetry**. In *Song of the Bronze Immortal’s Farewell to the Han* (《金铜仙人辞汉歌》), he uses **historical allusions, vivid imagery, and philosophical reflection** to mourn the decline of the Han Dynasty and comment on the impermanence of power and beauty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **1. Historical & Cultural Context**

### **The Bronze Immortal Statue (金铜仙人)**

The poem centers around a **large bronze statue of an immortal**, which originally stood in **Weiyang Palace** (the main palace of the Western Han Dynasty in Chang'an). It symbolized the **glory of the Han Empire**.

-   

-   During the **Three Kingdoms period**, when the **Cao Wei state** overtook Han rule, the statue was **taken from Chang'an** and transported eastward.

-   

-   This event serves as **a metaphor for the fall of the Han Dynasty**—the symbol of its past grandeur is now being forcibly moved.

-   

### **Li He’s Perspective**

Li He lived during the **Tang Dynasty**, centuries after Han’s fall, but he **saw parallels between Tang and Han**—great empires that, despite their power, were destined to decline. This poem reflects **his anxiety over history repeating itself**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Literary Devices & Themes**

### **① Imagery & Symbolism of Decay**

Li He contrasts **past glory** with **present decay** using **rich, evocative imagery**.

-   

-   **宫女如花满春殿， 只今惟有鹧鸪飞。**\

    *(Once, palace ladies bloomed like flowers in spring halls, Now, only partridges fly there.)*

    -   

    -   This **contrast between human presence and emptiness** creates a haunting sense of loss.

    -   

    -   The **partridge (鹧鸪)** is often associated with sorrow in Chinese poetry, symbolizing **the silence left behind after the dynasty’s fall**.

    -   

-   

-   **三十六宫土花碧。**\

    *(Thirty-six palaces now covered in green moss and dust.)*

    -   

    -   The once-grand palaces of Han are now **abandoned and overgrown**, symbolizing **the inevitability of decline**.

    -   

-   

### **② Personification of Heaven & the Moon**

One of the most famous lines in Chinese poetry:

> **天若有情天亦老，月如无恨月长圆。**\
>
> *(If heaven had emotions, even it would grow old; If the moon had no regrets, it would always remain full.)*

-   

-   **Personification of Heaven (天)**: Suggests that **if even nature could feel sorrow, it would wither like humans**.

-   

-   **Symbolism of the Moon (月)**: The moon **waxing and waning** is a metaphor for **life’s cycles**, but here it’s used ironically—the moon appears eternal, **indifferent to human suffering**.

-   

-   **Daoist & Buddhist Influence**: This reflects Daoist ideas of **detachment from worldly concerns** and Buddhist notions of **impermanence (无常, wúcháng)**.

-   

### **③ Metaphor of the Bronze Immortal**

-   

-   The statue is **not just an object**, but a **witness to history**.

-   

-   It serves as a **symbol of fallen dynasties**—once mighty, now displaced, just like the Han ruling family.

-   

### **④ Allusions to Historical Figures & Events**

-   

-   **“茂陵刘郎” (Maoling Liu Lang)**

    -   

    -   Refers to Emperor Wu of Han (汉武帝, Liu Che), one of Han’s greatest rulers, buried in **Maoling**.

    -   

    -   "Liu Lang" (刘郎, "Liu Gentleman") could refer to **a ghostly figure lamenting the empire’s decline**.

    -   

-   

-   **“魏官牵车指千里”** *(Wei officials pull the cart a thousand miles away.)*

    -   

    -   Wei was the **state that replaced Han**, and its officials taking the statue away symbolizes **the end of Han’s legacy**.

    -   

    -   The **forced movement of the statue = forced collapse of an empire**.

    -   

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Philosophical Reflection: Impermanence & Fate**

### **The Universe’s Indifference to Human Suffering**

The poem suggests that **heaven and nature are indifferent to human emotions**. Dynasties rise and fall, but:

-   

-   The **moon remains full**, indifferent to human joy or sorrow.

-   

-   The **sky does not age**, because it does not feel.

-   

This reflects a **pessimistic but profound worldview**—empires, rulers, and even beauty are **all temporary**, but the universe remains unchanged.

### **Cycles of History & Warning for the Tang Dynasty**

By lamenting Han’s fall, Li He may be subtly **warning the Tang Dynasty**: **No matter how powerful an empire seems, it will eventually decline**. This was a common theme in **Tang poetry**, as scholars saw signs of decay in their own time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Influence & Legacy**

-   

-   **One of Li He’s most famous works**, still quoted today.

-   

-   The line **"天若有情天亦老"** is widely used in literature, philosophy, and even pop culture (e.g., martial arts novels, films).

-   

-   Themes of **historical cycles, lost grandeur, and philosophical detachment** resonate deeply in **Chinese classical thought**.

-   

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Conclusion: A Timeless Reflection on Power & Time**

《金铜仙人辞汉歌》 is **not just a lament for the Han Dynasty** but a **meditation on history, fate, and the fleeting nature of human achievements**. Li He’s use of **haunting imagery, historical allusions, and deep philosophical reflection** makes it a masterpiece of **Tang poetry**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a full short story based on the outline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **The Bronze Immortal's Lament**

The first time Dr. Liu Cheng saw the Bronze Immortal, he was a child. His grandfather had taken him to the ruins of Weiyang Palace, where the massive statue stood against the setting sun, its expression unreadable, its hands stretched toward an empire that no longer existed.

*"It has been here since the Han Dynasty,"* his grandfather had whispered. *"It has seen emperors rise and fall, dynasties crumble, and history rewritten. But it never speaks. It only watches."*

Now, decades later, Liu stood before the statue once more. But this time, it was surrounded by machinery, its base chained, its fate decided. The government had ordered its relocation—a new high-tech museum in the east would house it, far from the land it had watched over for centuries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. The Announcement**

The relocation was part of the *Cultural Heritage Advancement Plan*, a project meant to *"preserve history through modernization."* Officials claimed the Bronze Immortal would be better protected in a controlled environment, displayed alongside holographic reconstructions of the Han Dynasty.

To Liu, this was **not preservation, but exile**.

"Weiyang Palace is where it belongs," he argued at a press conference. "History is not meant to be moved like furniture. This statue has stood here for two thousand years—it is a part of the land, a witness to time."

But the decision had already been made. Minister Fang, a senior official in charge of the relocation, merely adjusted his glasses and replied, "History must be protected, Dr. Liu. We cannot let the past be consumed by time."

Liu left the meeting in silence, but as he stepped outside, he saw the protests beginning.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. The Journey Begins**

Days later, the Bronze Immortal was hoisted onto a massive transport vehicle. The roads leading out of Chang’an were lined with protesters, holding signs that read *"Let History Rest"* and *"The Bronze Immortal Belongs Here."*

Among them was Wei Han, a journalist who had initially covered the story as a routine cultural piece. But something about the statue’s **silent dignity** unsettled him. It reminded him of **stories his grandmother had told about how history had a way of vanishing**—not just in books, but in the minds of people.

He began digging deeper, combing through old archives. What he found **disturbed him**.

The government’s plan was not just about moving the statue—it was about **erasing certain parts of history**. Documents revealed that the project was designed to **redirect public attention away from the original sites of the Han Dynasty**, reinforcing a **new national narrative**.

"The past is being rewritten," Wei muttered, watching the convoy disappear into the horizon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. The Storm & the Ruins**

Two nights into the journey, a storm broke over the northern plains.

The transport convoy slowed as rain turned the roads into rivers. The Bronze Immortal, wrapped in steel cables, stood on the flatbed truck like a prisoner in transit. Minister Fang, following in an armored vehicle, tapped his fingers against the glass, feeling a strange unease.

That was when the landslide hit.

A section of the mountain crumbled, sending rocks and mud onto the road. The truck skidded, tires screeching, before toppling over into a ravine. When the dust settled, the convoy’s searchlights illuminated the fallen statue—**half-buried, its outstretched hand pointing toward the earth like a final plea.**

As dawn broke, an astonishing discovery was made.

The statue had **landed at the entrance of a long-hidden underground chamber**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. The Chamber of Lost History**

Dr. Liu Cheng arrived within hours. When he saw where the statue had fallen, his breath caught in his throat. **An ancient stone doorway had been exposed**, its inscriptions unmistakably Han Dynasty.

Wei Han arrived next, camera in hand. Minister Fang stood nearby, his usual calm demeanor shaken.

Liu ran his hands over the inscriptions. The characters were worn but legible:

*"When empires forget their past, they walk toward their end."*

Further inside the chamber, they found **a hidden archive of Han Dynasty records**—documents untouched by time. They detailed **histories that had been lost or deliberately erased**, including records of rebellions, betrayals, and forgotten rulers.

"This…" Liu whispered. "This changes everything."

The discovery was seismic. If revealed, it would challenge **the very foundation of official history**.

And yet, Minister Fang hesitated.

"Some things are better left buried," he murmured.

"You mean erased," Wei Han shot back. "Like you're trying to erase the Bronze Immortal’s place in history?"

For the first time, Minister Fang had no answer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. The Decision**

News of the discovery spread quickly. The government tried to **contain** the information, but it was too late. Public pressure **forced an emergency review** of the relocation plan.

Minister Fang, once a loyal bureaucrat, found himself standing at a crossroads. He had spent his career ensuring that history was shaped, controlled, and framed neatly for future generations. But now, confronted with the **undeniable weight of the past**, he **chose to defy his orders**.

"The Bronze Immortal stays," he declared.

The government relented. The statue was **returned to Weiyang Palace**, where it had stood for two millennia. The underground chamber was **preserved as a historical site**, its lost histories made public.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **6. The Bronze Immortal Watches**

Months later, Liu Cheng stood once more before the statue.

It had been cleaned and restored, but its expression remained unchanged—watchful, distant, eternal.

Wei Han’s article had gone viral. The public’s outcry had **forced a shift in policy**, leading to renewed interest in **preserving historical sites instead of relocating them**. Minister Fang had resigned, leaving behind a letter:

*"I spent my life trying to shape history. But history is not ours to shape—it is ours to remember."*

As the evening sun cast long shadows, Liu ran his fingers across the base of the statue. Among its ancient engravings, he found a single line that had never caught his attention before:

**天若有情天亦老**\

*"If heaven had emotions, even it would grow old."*

Liu stepped back and smiled. The Bronze Immortal had outlasted empires, storms, and time itself.

And it would remain—silent, patient, watching.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Themes & Reflection**

-   

-   **History Cannot Be Controlled** – No matter how much people try to rewrite or relocate history, **truth finds a way to surface**.

-   

-   **Impermanence (无常)** – Empires rise and fall, leaders come and go, but **some things endure beyond human control**.

-   

-   **The Power of Memory** – The past is not just records in books; **it is the land, the people, and the silent watchers who refuse to be forgotten**.

These records… they were never meant to be found.

*A long silence. MINISTER FANG steps forward, gazing at the inscriptions. His voice is quiet, troubled.*

Perhaps some things are better left buried.

##### **LIU CHENG** *(turning to him)*
