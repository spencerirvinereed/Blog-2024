During a recent break, tried to recall names of people I have met and those that influenced me over the years.

Typically, a person meets or knows about a thousand person in their lifetime.

Scores of names came to mind almost immediately.

Then I ran into trouble.

I could remember their roles and places I visited, but I could not recall their names.

For example, recalled the head of quality function for Asia Pacific.

She was from Singapore, and made several visits to 구미, at times during winter months.

I was able to recall more names, when I broke my life into segments.

-   East Coast days in Maryland.
-   Mission service in California.
-   Education at Provo.
-   Managers and co-workers at various companies
-   대구/구미 Years
-   YSA involvement, 1990s and 2020s.

Noticed that my recollection was biased towards recent engagements

## Name Card Holder to the Rescue

Found 3 business card holders from business-focused travelling days.

Found Norio S. who met us at the Komatsu Airport.

Also Ginny C who visited us along with Koh-Chee H

A 2" x 3" business card contains

-   who we are
-   what we do to make a living
-   where is that place of work
-   ways to contact us

Reading the name, role and the workplace location, along with few dates and notes that were hand written, triggered many more memories.

I plan to contact them and thank them for guiding me in this life.

Looking at the card not only made me reminisce about old days but also think ahead.

The role of a business card has diminished and replaced by the on-line presence.

-   what would the card or profile say, after the vocation or career is over

How about at the end of our temporal life

-   what would the card, or the grave marker, say at the end of our lives.

As our physical abilities decrease and memories fade, it is good to have physical markers or name cards, and memory joggers to remind us of our associations; before, here and now and hereafter.

> What will be the last and enduring name card or life story in this life and here after?

It will be a reflection of what remains in our heart, mind and spirit.

In this life, it is our countenance.

In the coming life, it will likely be the awareness of ourselves and the relationship with those we have met and have had associations.
