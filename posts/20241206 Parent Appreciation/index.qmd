Life is a race to appreciate, learn and implement guiding truths.

One of the truths that needs to be understood is,

> How awe inspiring our parents are.

While they are with us, we seldom express appreciation for their presence.

At times, we seem to pay far more attention to what others are doing, what is happening at work.

We are focused on what is important to us.

But our parents always place our welfare, first and foremost.

But when they are no longer with us, we miss their wisdom and love, and their being.

At some point in our lives, we transform.

From a receiver to a giver.

No longer interested in drawing attention to ourselves but to an understanding, lifting, and healing role. From an ambitious person to an appreciative person.

In short, we take place of our parents.

Recall a children story

**청개구리 (young blue frog)**

*There was a young frog that disobeyed his mother.*  *In fact, he did opposite of what was asked of him.*  *His wayward ways affected his mom and her health deteriorated.*

*As a last wish, she asked him to bury her near the river.*\
*Thinking that he would disobey and bury her in the mountain, away from the flooding river.*\
*At last, the son reconsidered and followed mother's wish and she was buried by the river.*

*Till this day, young frogs, cries (croaks) when the weather turns foul, worried that the grave would be washed away.*

During the summer of 2023, a memorial was held for a pioneering Korean member.

Marking the 20 years since his passing.

His only son was conducting the meeting.

As he began, he dispelled a thought some of us had,

> This is not some reincarnation, I am the son.

But for us who knew the father, the son looked and sounded like his father.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started to look like my father about 2 decades ago, with some features, influenced by my mother.

Moreover, people begin to look and behave like their parents, because they have shared in life's journey and experienced common events that pulls them together.

That life is mostly cloudy, with threats of storm, and few intermingled calm, sunny days.

With hint of hopes of spring, a harvest of autumn, but mostly filled with a summer of toil and loneliness of winter.

I don't know how many times my parents failed in their lifetime.

I do know they continued after setback.

Because of challenges in life, they knew how to handle tough situations with wisdom.

In addition, throughout their life on this earth, my parents demonstrated this passage,

> “*He is* my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”

They were the rock, a foundation that we can build on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Their lessons on life are meaningful and memorable because they lived it and lived through it.

Their stories of the war, poverty, and re-starting, multiple times, seemed like a distant, borrowed story.

No longer.

I am grateful that I parents that loved me abundantly and showed it.

For better part of their lives, they cared more for the lives of their children.

I have learned from them.

I appreciate, all of their sacrifice and love.

Now it is time to reciprocate their love by remembering who they are and what they stood for.

Implementing their teachings in my life.
