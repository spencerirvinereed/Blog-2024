Driving up to the big city to the north, Sister K reminded me of a time my father taught a truth.

Once, my father said to me,

> This feels even better than when you were born.

We were welcoming our 2nd child.

He was almost 62 years old.

At the time I heard it, I was a bit confused.

> How can a birth of a grandchild top the birth of your own son?

Sometimes I forget that my father had to grow up faster than most.
He was already working full time and earning income that would support a family — as a teenager.
He really had no childhood that we normally think of.

His father and his older brother that he looked up to became MIAs when my father was 20 years old.

My father's life was preserved during the Korean War^[<https://oakhi.github.io/Life-Begins-When/posts/20230727%20Korean%20War%20Remembrance/>]

He cherished years after the war, as a bonus and a blessing from the Almighty.

Thus when my son was born, he had been working, as a head of a household, for nearly 50 years.

He had the perspective, he had gained knowledge, and he could state the truth that we learn as we age.

In some ways, echoing words of Simeon, as recorded in Luke, Chapter 2.^[New International Version]

^**25**^ Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. ^**26**^ It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. ^**27**^ Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, ^**28**^ Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:

^**29**^ “Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,\
    you may now dismiss^\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202%3A25-35&version=NIV#fen-NIV-25003a "See footnote a")\]^ your servant in peace.\
^**30**^ For my eyes have seen your salvation,\
^**31**^     which you have prepared in the sight of all nations:\
^**32**^ a light for revelation to the Gentiles,\
    and the glory of your people Israel.”

^**33**^ The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. ^**34**^ Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, ^**35**^ so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.”

Birth of a new soul brings a consolation and a fresh hope for the tired and soon-to-be-forgotten generation.

As one generation prepares to meet God and give account of one's life, another generation is brought forth.

Erasing the wrongs of a society, overcoming burdens of fathers, and fulfilling dreams of mothers.

I repeat the words of my father,

It is good to witness births of new generation of spirits.

Ones prepared and endowed with talents and the will to overcome and fulfill promises made to our progenitors.

Welcome!
