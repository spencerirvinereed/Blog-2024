Our mother was many things to many people in her lifetime.

She was for us an advocate, a teacher, a care give. She was great at things she tried.

She was also a knitter,

> someone who makes garments (or fabrics) by intertwining yarn or thread\^\[<https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/knitter#:~:text=Definitions%20of%20knitter,or%20embroidery)%20with%20a%20needle>\]

Ever since I can remember, there was always yarns in the house. My mom would be creating something out of those.

One time, in her 40s, she organized a small army of ladies, who knitted alongside her. They were working on knitted products, hats, booties for newborn babies, destined to be exported to US.

She expanded her repertoire,

She could knit sweaters and vests.

She would knit for her grandchildren and great grandchildren

the handles are worn and frailing.

More valuable than any bag out there

She was creative but ever expanding
