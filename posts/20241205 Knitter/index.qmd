Our mother was many things to many people in her lifetime.

She was for us an advocate, a teacher, a care give. She was great at things she tried.

She was also a knitter,

> someone who makes garments (or fabrics) by intertwining yarn or thread\^\[<https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/knitter#:~:text=Definitions%20of%20knitter,or%20embroidery)%20with%20a%20needle>\]

Ever since I can remember, there was always yarns in the house. My mom would be creating something out of those.

One time, in her 40s, she organized a small army of ladies, who knitted alongside her. They were working on knitted products, hats, booties for newborn babies, destined to be exported to US.

She expanded her repertoire,

She could knit sweaters and vests.

She would knit for her grandchildren and great grandchildren

I have a bag she made over a decade ago.

the handles are worn and frailing.

More valuable than any bag out there

She was creative but ever expanding

실과 바늘, 가위 등을 이용해 스웨터, 모자, 장갑, 양말, 목도리, 인형 등 니트 직물(편물, 수편물)을 결여서 만드는 일.

뜨개질로 만들어진 니트는 직물에 비해 신축성 및 통기성이 좋지만, 실 한 가닥을 줄줄 엮어서 천 모양을 만드는 방식이기에 일부분 손상 시 복구가 까다롭다. 작업 중에도 한참 전에 틀린 부분이 있을 경우 수정하기가 정말로 고통스러워진다.

Using thread, needles, scissors, and other tools, items such as sweaters, hats, gloves, socks, scarves, and dolls are made by creating knit fabric (knitted or hand-knitted materials).

Knitted items made through this method have better elasticity and breathability compared to woven fabrics. However, since the fabric is created by looping a single thread continuously, it can be difficult to repair if a part is damaged. Additionally, if an error from much earlier in the process is discovered during work, correcting it can be quite labor-intensive and frustrating.
