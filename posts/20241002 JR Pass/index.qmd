## The Website

[Japan Rail Pass](https://japanrailpass.net/en/purchase/)

A search of key word `JR Pass Purchase` brings up a dozen or so similar websites.

While there may not be any differences, one thing to consider and confirm is,

> Can I reserve tickets in advance?

Similarly,

> Can I print those tickets from the vending machine, bypassing the often crowded, JR Ticket Office.

The JR Pass is no longer a phenomenal bargain it used to be.

Price increased by 70% in October 2023.

However, if you plan to travel to multiple cities farther than 200 km, it may be still worthwhile to purchase the Pass.

For instance, Kyoto, one of the more popular destination in Japan, is 456 km from Tokyo Station. To drive that distance takes nearly six hours.

The Hikari Shinkansen option costs 13,320 but it will take you there in 2 hours and 40 minutes using the Hikari, the limited express option.

See Table and Chart Below

Here’s a tabulated list showing the **travel time** and **cost** from Tokyo to Kyoto using the three different Shinkansen types (Nozomi, Hikari, and Kodama) and their seat classes:
