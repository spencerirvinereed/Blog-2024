I remember watching my father preparing his lunch.\
I would have missed seeing it, except he prepared his lunch, the night before.

My father and mother drove together and needed to leave early.\
First to Washington DC to drop off mother, who never had a driver's license.

Packing his own lunch meant he saved on money but he seldom had variety.

---

His chosen vocation or the one assigned by life, was that he worked away from city centers. 

A quarry, with plenty space and water running through it. 
Like a scene from the cartoon series Flintstones

Once I went to his work place. AH Smith, the company that sponsored his visa had an operation near present day Greenbelt Metro Station.

Another time his work was in Silver Hill Area.
A food truck came and nearly all people purchase either a drink, food or snack.

But not my father, he and I ate simple food that he had prepared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder if he ever felt that he could be in a different role. Did he ever consider taking a role that would allow him to work from home.

If those thoughts crossed his mind, he never showed it. I was brought up in an environment of stable family life.

Whereas, he himself grew up in a home where his father often neglected his duty. Grandfather's life was consumed with alcohol and its attendant vices. Gambling was particularly a problem for him.

I am grateful that my father neither smoked or drank. That alone set his path to a vastly different destination.

---

I am also grateful that he took time to teach me to work. 
By demonstrating the role of a father and the meaning of economic provider. 
The value of work, thrift and fortitude

Created and forged in years of participating and surviving a war

Years of working in a quarry.

Have had number of days that are difficult. And there will be more in the future.

However, I am going to persevere like my father did Thanks Dad, because you showed how to take the work to a child
