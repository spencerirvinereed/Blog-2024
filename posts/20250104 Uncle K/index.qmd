I have a 작은아버지 (little father), youngest brother of my father.

He was born 13 years after my father and lived with us until I was almost 10.

He was a story teller and a singer.

The same that entertained crowds on a train and sold bogus medicine to make some money, as a student.

He quit smoking when our daughter was a baby.

Not good for the baby.

Later, in his 70s, he quit drinking as well.

By then, the alcohol had taken its toll on the body.

He needed surgery to remove cancerous growth.

He also bough mom some much needed, desired food, when she was expecting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

He also wrote out the whole Bible by hand, in English.

> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,

Upon my mom's passing, he declared that she had elevated his life.

Had she not insisted on his education, his life would have taken a different direction, certainly not in the current level of living.

He went to school during a time when most families in Korea subsisted on a few hundred dollars a year.

Whether because his older didn't go to school, or my mother didn't finish schooling, we don't know, but my mom made sure he was funded and he graduated.
