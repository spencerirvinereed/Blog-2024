If the man-made borders were removed, to which country would people congregate to.

Not as visitors and tourists but as pioneers, immigrants, settlers.

Somewhere within the earth should be an easy task.

As immigrants, as visitors.

Actually, we alreday have that situation.

People are free to visit other nations, for the most part

Someone has said that immigration is a search for better economic opportunity.
