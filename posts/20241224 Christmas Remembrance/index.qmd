The speaker began,

> We only use the term, "Merry" for one holiday.

She explained the usage began in 1500s and popularized during 1800s with the publication of the Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.

Highlighted the difference between Happy and Merry.

> Happy describes an emotion, something we feel inside.
>
> Merry is a description of our behavior, how we act to be merry is to be cheerful, lively, joyous, festive.

Thinking over her message, have come to realize that I had been passive about many things in life, including celebrations in life, including Christmas. 

Trying to fill my life with happiness, that can be purchased, borrowed, earned at the expense of others.

For me, the year-end holidays, sometime ago, ceased to be a celebration â€“ more of a chore.

An adjournment from a hectic, energy sapping, part of a daily modern work life.

But, a rejuvenation occurred as I watched the next generation and their off-springs welcome the Christmas with merriment.

The settings were certainly festive, food was delicious and plentiful.

The activities and games were appropriate for all ages and everyone took part.

All of our spirits were raised, it was a joyous event.

Remembered a saying by Sister K.

According to old people, there is an exchange that occurs when old and young are mingling.

The young imparts youthful energy, their cheerful way.

The old shares life's lessons via their actions, however limiting its influence might be.

I will put off the Scrooge-like ways

I hope to be more active in coming days and be Merry
