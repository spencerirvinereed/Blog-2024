Played a set of audio cassette tapes from the turn of the century.

These were recording of saints in 대구 area.

At times, we were singing, spiritual as well as popular songs.

Sometimes, we were meeting in a chapel and lifting one another.

They were repeating gospel principles.

But because they were speaking in Korean.

It touched me more.

Tape size, **4" × 2½" × ½"**

Tape length, A 60 minute cassette is 30 minutes on a side at 1–7/8 IPS. It would be 1–7/8″ (1.875″) X 60 seconds X 30 minutes divided by 12 to get feet. So it would be **281.25 feet**. So the 90 minute version would be 1.5 times that or 421.90 feet.
