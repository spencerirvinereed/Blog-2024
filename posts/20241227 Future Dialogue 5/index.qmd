**손자(孫子):** Grandpa, heard you say 2024 was a pivotal year for you, why?

**Older Me:** Each year can be and is pivotal.

That year I wrote more than earlier years. I was still struggling with loss of my parents, adapting to a new role as the leading generation, challenge at work, and changes in society.

I transferred some lingering thoughts and pains into words.

Looking back, reading those words again, made me realize much change had occurred in the world, but more so within me.

**손자(孫子):** Why did you continue to record thoughts, if you felt pain?

**Older Me:** During those years, I was dependent on others to help me understand complexities of the world and new technologies that seem to defy prevailing logic.

It was a fast paced world. Much like now, but to those of us that weren't used to it, we had to adjust.

I listened to popular contents on YouTube and AI Agent explanations. They helped but I was becoming too reliant on them.

I began to think, how did my parents survive?

They missed out on their education. Yet, they managed to make a living and provided a foundation for the next generation.

For instance, they could, match Chat Bot response time, in analyzing the situation and give a proper solution. They could also predict, with a good accuracy, a type of person they meet for the first time.

How did they build that kind of LLM database?

**손자(孫子):** I am going to guess, their faith in God and their experiences.

**Older Me:** I agree.

Although, they didn't write down most of their observations. I learned their teachings through the stories they told.

I regret that I didn't fully capture their original words, but I am trying to write them down, to the best of my recollections.

**손자(孫子):** Going back to that pivotal year, what was it about writing that helped you most?

**Older Me:** Writing has multiple benefits we know.

That year, I re-read this passage.

> I may have very few good traits, but one trait which I do possess is my inability to imitate anyone else. I always want to be myself and to display my unique dignity of having been created in the image of God. The glory of the individual is exemplified by the singularity of every human being. This concept is the motto of my life.

> I do not like to do what others can do better or just as well. I wish to do that which I am unique at! This is not an expression of haughtiness; no, it is a fulfillment of my intrinsic human dignity and individuality.[^1]

[^1]: Joseph B. Soloveitchik, “21.02 Yeshiva University I,” in Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff, The Rav: The World of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik  vol. 2, ed. Joseph Epstein (Brooklyn, New York: KTAV Publishing House, 1999), 225–26.

And as I wrote down my memories, I began to realize,

> ...how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts

-   Moroni 10:3

I began to be grateful for the knowledge of the Plan. And my parent's role and sacrifice.

Also understood, what I needed to do.

Understand my role in the family and society and become better at it.

Through study and practice.

Thus making my own unique contribution.

**손자(孫子):** What advise do you have for me?

**Older Me:** That quote attributed to Eames.

> Never delegate understanding

As recorded, study it out in your mind, consult best resources, including those close to you.

Write down what you know and feel at that time. Let the higher power, fill in the missing pieces.

**손자(孫子):** Thanks Grandpa, any last thoughts?

**Older Me:** It takes time, but this is a good indicator of truth.

> ...By their fruits, ye shall know them
