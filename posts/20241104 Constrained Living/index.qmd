There comes a time when one realizes that there are laws or constraints that govern our lives, our society, our universe

Rather than trying to fit the law into our way of living.

We change our lives to fit that constraint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike youthful thinking, true freedom is not to have regulations or laws or free from it.

Whether the guidance comes from personal conviction, community standard, religious upbringing, the closer one lives according to this guidance, more happy one will be.
