Freedom in this life is having some burden, a constraint, a cross.

Some call it a yoke.

This life is finite and so is our freedom, limited

Those that have been involved with life and by connection family will have an easier transition.

Whether the guidance comes from personal conviction, community standard, religious upbringing, the closer one lives according to this guidance, more happy one will be.
