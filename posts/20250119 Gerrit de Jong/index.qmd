One Christmas, someone was pushing an unlighted car across the street.

Gerrit (1892-1978) and Rosabelle (1889-1940) were coming down from Salt Lake City.

de Jong's car hit the unlighted car.

Belle de Jong (1919-2009) and Dean Van Wagenen (1914-1997),[^1] who were married in 1939, moved into her parent's home to take care of her.

Rosabelle, who was badly injured and she passed away, shortly thereafter.

Rosabelle and Gerrit had 4 children.[^2]

Their oldest, a son, passed away in infancy.

Belle was the oldest, Nola (1924-2015) then Carma (1930-2022).

Gerrit decided not to remarry until his children had grown and moved out of the home.[^3]

During this time, Nola mentioned there was a Chinese student that needed a place to stay.

Jean Char Gong, the mother of Elder Gong, lived with the de Jong family while attending Brigham Young University in Provo.[^4]

Nola said of her father,[^5]

> ...father learned something new every day of his life—on purpose. “And when he learned something, he continued to focus on it, such as learning Chinese,” Sullivan says. “He had just finished printing the parts for a string quartet, out of some piano dances by Cesar Cui, the week he died. Nothing short of excellence was acceptable. He was a darling man who was productive to the end.”

Gerrit Gong would call the oldest daughter of Belle de Jong Van Wagenen when he would visit Provo.

At a devotional at `This Is the Place Heritage Park`, Elder Gong explained his name.[^6]

> My name is Gerrit Walter Gong. Gerrit is a Dutch name. It comes from Gerrit de Jong, the first dean of fine arts at Brigham Young University. My mother stayed with his family as a young student at BYU. Walter is an American name, chosen by my father, Walter A. Gong, while he served in the U.S. Navy. Gong is a Chinese surname that means “river.”

This is a story of how Elder Gong obtained the given name of Gerrit, from the de Jong family POV.
