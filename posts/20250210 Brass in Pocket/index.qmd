> Speak like I defected

That was what I remembered the line to be.

Recently I looked up what the actual lyric was.

I was way off,

>Don't get me wrong\
If I split like light refracted\
I'm only off to wander\
Across a moonlit mile

For some reason, I thought my interpretation flowed with the intent of the song

Growing up with 2 older sisters meant, you would listen to some of their music.

I had my records/vinyls of Led Zeppelin, Eagles, and some Beatles.
