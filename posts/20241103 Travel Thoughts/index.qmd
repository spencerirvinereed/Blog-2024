A Sunday school teacher quoted a leader who compared the Book of Mormon to visiting a well-established, well-known places.

> ... we as church members sometimes behave like hurried tourists scarcely entering beyond the entry hall.

I have visited famous sites using a group, guided tours and individually planned visits In both instances, I have been that `hurried tourist` who `scarcely entered beyond the entry hall`

Thus far in this life, I failed to take full advantage or the opportunities in physical and spiritual journeys as I should.

From now on, I will be more deliberate in my journeys.

By preparing before the journey, by understanding the purpose of my travels and by being mindful of the fellow travelers.

The importance of the travel is not the destination but being mindful of the companions that I am traveling with and understanding and accepting who is ultimately in charge.

## Reasons for Travel

Vacation is "an extended period of leisure and recreation, especially one spent away from home or in traveling."

And, "the action of leaving something one previously occupied."

For most of my life life, I have followed the first definition, a recreational, a renewal, an escape from the day to day.

Something my parents never took part in. For they were busy building a life in America.

More and more, I like to think of travel as an act of leaving behind the current life and looking for an educational and transformational experience

## Lessons from a travel

Recently saw a lady sitting on steps leading to a station exit. She was slouched over and a younger lady with 2 children was by her and offering assistance.

She seemed to be in her 80s, had a small backpack, and seemed to be exhausted. The younger lady approached the stationmaster and asked for help.

The stationmaster left his post and offered his assistance. He helped her to her feet and both of them, one leaning on the other, made their way towards the gate.

In a hurry to get to the next destination, connecting flight or train, next meal, the everyday scenes and persons are obscured.

While some of us are busy filling our memory vaults with newly discovered places, majority of the locals were making through another daily challenge. For the lady, her body's ability to meet, a life's challenges was fading from her.

Larger cities have millions of residences. What percentages are fully engaged, what percentages are slowly fading? Are there some that are obscured or not visible at all by the public.

Of necessity, cities are built and maintained by the strength and vigor of youth. When vigor and strength are no longer, to whom and to what resources can on turn?

## Scheduling and Coordinator

My mother's family were taste coordinators in their respective neighborhood. During celebrations, which usually involved a feast, they made adjustments to dishes that enhanced the natural flavor and provide a uniformity as if made by a single person, even though many hands were involved.

To address the complexity of today's world, we sometimes employ event coordinators and project coordinators. Their role is to devise and execute a plan that ensures expressed and unexpressed desires are met and that events and projects proceed as if a single person is running it.

Likewise, we need and have life coordinators.

These are individual(s) that know us, have our welfare at forefront, at times work with us, sometimes work for us, and even carry us through difficult times.

Important to not schedule all available resources and time. To allow good of others to fill in our inadequacies. Also allowing the ultimate coordinator, God, to re-assign our roles or significantly change the scope of our adventure in this life.

## Lasting Legacies from Short Visits

Unfortunately, memories and impact from vacations do not last. This may lead some to schedule another travel in coming days.

It is important to visit sites and places However, far more important who we travel with and what transformation takes place because we travelled.

We will spend most of our lives and most of our vacation time moving towards our destinations. Our ultimate destination is same, but we will all take the individualized, custom paths.

The person assigned to travel with us may be few or many. Some will be seen, others felt.

God has told us the plan, the plan of happiness. He will provide means and ways that will help us realize that the act of service is the pathway to understanding and transformation

## Book of Mormon Impact

> “The Book of Mormon is like a vast mansion, with gardens, towers, courtyards, and wings. My tour of it has never been completed. Some rooms I have yet to enter, and there are more felicitous fireplaces waiting to warm me. Even the rooms I have glimpsed contain further furnishings and rich detail yet to be savored. There are panels inlaid with incredible insights, and design and décor dating from Eden. There are even sumptuous banquet tables painstakingly prepared by predecessors which await all of us.

The church leader, Neal A. Maxwell stated in October, 1986

I have visited a few places for days or weeks at a time, a tiny part of this earth. I have gained some understanding from those visits.

I have lived in the same neighborhood for a number decades.

I have come in contact with coordinators and have coordinated a few things for others. From these interactions I have come to better understand, what Neal A Maxwell calls `the modern man’s architectonic needs`

-   that is, our deep needs to discern some design, purpose, pattern, or plan regarding human existence.

I hope to follow his invitation,

> May we come to feel, as a whole people, beckoned beyond the entry hall. May we go inside far enough to hear clearly the whispered truths from those who have slumbered – which whisperings will awaken in us individually a life of discipleship as never before.” Neal A. Maxwell, [Great Answers to the Great Question](http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&id=918&tid=2 "Great Answers to the Great Question"), FARMS Address, 10/86
