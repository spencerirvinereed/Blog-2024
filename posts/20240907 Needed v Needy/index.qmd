    What are 2 things that perhaps a person can do to

-   00:07

    find answers or find for himself or herself

-   00:12

    a connection to a higher power

-   00:13

    or the purpose for their life?

-   00:16

    The first thing is you have freedom of choice.

-   00:20

    And the choice you need to make is a very simple one.

-   00:25

    You can be needy.

-   00:28

    You can be needed.

-   00:31

    That's it. That's what it boils down to.

-   00:34

    You can focus on your needs, try to satisfy your needs,

-   00:37

    pursue your needs, do it your way, whatever that means,

-   00:45

    and you're gonna get depressed.

-   00:49

    Or you can focus on who needs you.

-   00:54

    We exist because we are needed.

-   00:58

    That's who we are. We are necessary.
