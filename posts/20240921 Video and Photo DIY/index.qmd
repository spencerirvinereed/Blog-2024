## Problem

Footage captured with cellphones, DSLRs and solid state portable recorders

Create an output that contains photos, video clips overlaid unto audio track.


Creating a music video with iMovie

## Collect Still Images (photographs)

Place them in the Movie Library by either importing or drag-and-drop method.

## Videos

iMovie is not compatible with .MP4 format.
Convert to .MOV format

## Multiple Tracks

Zoom H2n can create a 4-channel recording.
The recording is saved in 2 separate files.

- SR0001MS.WAV (The first file of MS, Side Microphones)
- SR0002XY.WAV (The first file of XY, Main 90-degree Microphones)

After photographs and videos are inserted in the Timeline, import tracks.

## Lessons Learned

- adding multiple tracks in iMovie
- mix multiple tracks into a stereo stream in Audacity
