I was ready to take the Monday off.

Snow came on time to make it feel like a long, restful weekend.

The weekend coincided with Mom's passing 2 years ago.

Small amount at 4500 ft were significantly more at this elevation \~(5100 ft). All of the graves looked the same.

Judging by my memory walked close to the spot.

Noticed there was a flower placed nearby. It was the grave of the family friend.

From there I could find where my parents are buried

## Navigation Methods

Before the advent of GPS, navigation relied on various methods that utilized natural elements, celestial bodies, and man-made tools. These techniques have been used throughout history by explorers, mariners, and travelers to find their way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Celestial Navigation**

Celestial navigation involves using the position of celestial bodies—such as the sun, moon, stars, and planets—to determine one’s position on Earth.

-   **Astrolabe**: Used by ancient mariners to measure the altitude of the sun or stars above the horizon.
-   **Sextant**: A more advanced tool that measures the angle between a celestial body and the horizon. Widely used in the age of exploration.
-   **North Star (Polaris)**: In the Northern Hemisphere, the North Star was a key reference point for determining direction, as it aligns closely with the Earth's axis of rotation.
-   **Sun**: Mariners and travelers used the sun’s position to estimate direction and time of day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. Dead Reckoning**

Dead reckoning involves estimating current position based on a previously determined position, using speed, elapsed time, and direction of travel.

-   **Log and Line**: Mariners threw a log tied to a line with knots at regular intervals into the water to measure speed.
-   **Compass**: A magnetic compass was essential for maintaining a steady course.
-   **Chronometer**: A precise timekeeping device used to calculate longitude by comparing local time with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. Terrestrial Navigation**

This method relies on landmarks and natural features for navigation.

-   **Maps**: Paper maps were a primary tool for land-based navigation, often used with a compass.
-   **Landmarks**: Mountains, rivers, and other prominent natural features helped travelers orient themselves.
-   **Trail Markers**: Travelers often left physical markers, such as cairns (stacks of stones), to guide others or themselves on return trips.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. Maritime Navigation**

For sea voyages, mariners used a combination of tools and techniques to navigate the open waters.

-   **Sounding Line**: A weighted line used to measure water depth, helping to determine proximity to land.
-   **Star Charts**: Used for identifying constellations and celestial navigation.
-   **Wind and Current Knowledge**: Mariners used prevailing wind patterns and ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, to plan routes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. Inertial Navigation**

Inertial navigation systems (INS) calculate position by measuring changes in motion, typically with gyroscopes and accelerometers.

-   While less accurate over time, INS was useful for aircraft and submarines before GPS became widespread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **6. Radio Navigation**

In the 20th century, radio-based navigation systems became prominent.

-   **LORAN (Long Range Navigation)**: Used low-frequency radio signals from fixed transmitters to determine position.
-   **Radio Beacons**: Aircraft and ships could use radio signals from beacons to triangulate their position.
-   **Direction Finders**: Devices that determined the direction of incoming radio signals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **7. Polynesian Navigation**

Polynesian navigators used sophisticated techniques based on natural cues to cross vast ocean distances.

-   **Star Maps**: Memorized patterns of stars rising and setting on the horizon.
-   **Wave Patterns**: Observed the direction and shape of ocean swells caused by winds and currents.
-   **Birds and Wildlife**: Noted the presence of specific birds or fish species that indicated proximity to land.
-   **Cloud Formations**: Certain cloud shapes and colors hinted at islands below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **8. Visual Cues**

Travelers often relied on their observations of natural phenomena.

-   **Shadow Sticks**: Simple tools to determine direction based on the movement of shadows during the day.
-   **Sunset and Sunrise**: Observed to approximate cardinal directions.
-   **Moss Growth**: Often used (though not always accurate), moss was thought to grow more on the north side of trees in the Northern Hemisphere.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **9. Trail Knowledge and Oral Tradition**

Many cultures relied on oral tradition and passed-down knowledge for navigation.

-   Indigenous peoples often memorized detailed descriptions of routes, landmarks, and seasonal changes.
-   Songs or stories sometimes encoded navigational information for easier recall.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **10. Natural Signs**

-   **Animal Behavior**: Noticing migratory patterns or flight paths of birds (e.g., seabirds returning to nesting areas).
-   **Wind Direction**: Sailors could navigate by understanding prevailing wind patterns.
-   **Color of Water**: Changes in water color near reefs or land helped mariners identify shallow areas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These methods represent centuries of ingenuity and adaptation to the challenges of travel and exploration. Each technique required skill, practice, and a deep understanding of the environment, laying the groundwork for the sophisticated GPS systems we rely on today.
