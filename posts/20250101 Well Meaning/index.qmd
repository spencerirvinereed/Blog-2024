On a traditional New Year's Day, Koreans gather as a family.

To welcome the Lunar New Year, and give 세배(歲拜).

Younger people greet their elders, a more formal, big bow, touching their heads to the ground.

Older people in turn gives 덕담.

> **덕담 (德談)** refers to well-meaning and virtuous words of encouragement, blessings, or good wishes often exchanged during special occasions in Korean culture, such as the New Year, weddings, birthdays, or significant milestones. Below are some examples of 덕담.

1.  **새해 복 많이 받으세요.**

    -   "Wishing you lots of blessings in the new year."\
        (A classic New Year’s greeting wishing for health and fortune.)

2.  **항상 건강하시고 하시는 일마다 잘되시길 바랍니다.**

    -   "May you always stay healthy and succeed in everything you do."

3.  **좋은 일만 가득하시고 웃음이 넘치는 한 해 되세요.**

    -   "May your year be filled with good things and overflowing with laughter."

We tried our best to replicate the way it was.

When the previous generation was in charge.

Didn't go as expected.

Missed having the older group, who knew us well.

They would have given the most appropriate, personalized advice.

Giving advice is tricky.

Persons learn from their experience.

Part of the advice giving is to provide that path of safety, risk averse approach.

Avoid those same hazards that brought the previous generation their wisdom.

Regardless, we receive similar advice and then give the same advice to the next generation.

The morning was bit chaotic.

Don't know if the younger generation got the meaning behind the tradition.

But then again, I probably didn't either until I had children of my own.

As my fellow hiker, Professor H likes to say.

> What has been will be again,\
>     what has been done will be done again;\
>     there is nothing new under the sun.

-   Ecclesiastes 1:9

It may seem new to the next generation until they reach the age of recognition.

Then it will be as if,

***"...What has been done will be done again..."***
