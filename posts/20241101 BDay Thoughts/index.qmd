Though we were refugees, a dozen year removed from the Korean War, our family was together.

Furthermore, both my father's and mother's family had clustered around 인천, as their temporary gathering place.

The prevailing thought during the War was that within 3 months, the War will be over and they will return and gather once more in their ancestral homes.
