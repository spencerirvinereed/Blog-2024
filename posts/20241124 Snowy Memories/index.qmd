First significant valley snow of the season brings back memories and a realization.

A realization that Utah is mostly a high desert and winters are swift and harsh.

It is also nice to remember younger days in a warmer climate, some 1000km to the southwest.

By walking the streets of KoreaTown and meeting people in and around Western, Olympic, and Vermont, I learned a few things.

I learned by observing others.

Successful people in the society and in the church.

To my young mind, some people seemed to have both.

I also rode buses and saw people people that were struggling -- outwardly.

Later I learned that some people used the church and abused the association with members.

The streets and buildings are still there.

However, people and businesses are different or new.

And in some ways, I have changed as well.

I came home from a mission with several gifts

-   An opportunity to study at a church sponsored university.
-   A better idea of my heritage and better equipped to speak the language of my parents
-   A desire to marry and establish a career.

Grateful for the experiences in K-Town LA and the people I have met.

Sister K also served in the California Los Angeles Mission, away from Koreatown.

Having just arrived in America and learning the language, the mission must have been a challenge.

Her older sister, who was waiting for her Visa to Korea, was assigned as a companion for the month of December.

During that time, after a number of rejections by the people, Sister K said to her sister.

> In the future, in my home, there will always be warm cookies that will welcome visitors.

I have always wanted to travel and visit the world.

And I would still travel outside of US, if I didn't have to pay for it.

Working for a multi-national company fulfilled some of my desires and set a precedence, that is hard to overcome.

Paying for travel with my own money.

Sister K chose a more worthwhile goal. Invite the world to visit our home.

Beginning with an apartment in Wymount, it seems we always had visitors.

Having visitors meant, there will be food, more than just warm cookies, usually a full course meal.

In all the houses and apartments, that we lived in over the years, we had the privilege of inviting people from near and far.

We have both been edified and enlightened by those visitors.

Sister K has fulfilled the Brigham Young University's motto.
