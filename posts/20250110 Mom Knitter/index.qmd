My mom a creator, expressed via knitting the yarn.

Maybe her family practiced elements of creativity while she was growing up.

Fostering creativity involves engaging in activities that encourage open-ended thinking, exploration, and the generation of new ideas. Here are some types of activities that can stimulate creativity:

She knitted scores of items for me and the family.

Even reaching out to church members and knitting bootys for the baby blessings

Great memories of vests, 마후라,

The other day, saw a grand daughter wearing one of mom's creations.

she looked great in that dress mom created

A Simple Bag

I have a bag that I have carried for nearly 20 years.

A simple bag made from a cloth.

It is a brown color with black palm trees implanted design.

I have carried that bag to many destinations around the world.

Currently, I use it as my daily lunch bag.

It's handles are ready to give out, due to wear.

I can purchase a new one but it wouldn't be the same.

This is a designer original.

My mom designed and saw ths special bag for me.

No other bag can match its significance for me.

Creating a beanie by knitting is a rewarding project that can be tailored to your skill level and desired style. Here's a step-by-step guide for knitting a simple beanie:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Materials Needed**

1.  **Yarn**: Choose a yarn suitable for beanies (e.g., wool, acrylic, or blends).
2.  **Knitting Needles**:
    -   Circular needles (16-inch length) and/or double-pointed needles (DPNs).
    -   Needle size as recommended on the yarn label.
3.  **Stitch Markers**: To mark the beginning of the round.
4.  **Tapestry Needle**: For weaving in ends.
5.  **Scissors**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Steps to Knit a Beanie**

#### **1. Choose Your Pattern**

-   Decide on the size (e.g., adult, child).
-   Select a design (plain, ribbed, striped, or with a pattern).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **2. Cast On Stitches**

-   Determine the number of stitches based on your pattern or gauge. A common cast-on for an adult beanie is 80–120 stitches.
-   Use a **long-tail cast-on** method for flexibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **3. Join in the Round**

-   If using circular needles, join the stitches into a circle, ensuring they are not twisted.
-   Place a stitch marker to indicate the beginning of the round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **4. Knit the Brim**

-   Work in a ribbing pattern (e.g., *Knit 1, Purl 1* or *Knit 2, Purl 2*) for 1–2 inches. Ribbing creates a stretchy brim that fits snugly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **5. Knit the Body**

-   Switch to stockinette stitch (*knit every stitch in the round*) for a smooth body.
-   Continue knitting until the beanie is the desired length (usually 6–7 inches from the cast-on edge for an adult size).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **6. Shape the Crown**

-   Begin decreasing to shape the top of the beanie:
    -   Divide stitches into sections (e.g., 8 sections for 80 stitches).
    -   Use a decrease pattern such as *Knit 8, Knit 2 Together* and repeat around.
    -   On subsequent rounds, reduce the number of stitches between decreases (e.g., *Knit 7, Knit 2 Together*).
-   Switch to double-pointed needles (DPNs) when the stitches become too tight for circular needles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **7. Close the Top**

-   When only a few stitches remain, cut the yarn, leaving a 6–8 inch tail.
-   Thread the yarn through the remaining stitches using a tapestry needle and pull tight to close the top.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **8. Finish the Beanie**

-   Weave in all loose ends with the tapestry needle.
-   Block the beanie if desired to shape and smooth the stitches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Optional Variations**

-   **Add a Pom-Pom**: Use a pom-pom maker or your hand to create a pom-pom and attach it to the top.
-   **Experiment with Patterns**: Incorporate cables, stripes, or colorwork for a more intricate design.
-   **Folded Brim**: Make a longer brim and fold it over for extra warmth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tips for Success

-   **Gauge Swatch**: Knit a small swatch to ensure your stitches match the pattern's gauge.
-   **Yarn Selection**: Opt for soft, warm yarns like merino wool for comfort.
-   **Practice Decreases**: Mastering neat decreases will give your beanie a polished look.

Enjoy the process, and soon you'll have a cozy, handmade beanie! Would you like advice on selecting yarn or needles for your project?

Perhaps she learned Jewish approach to creativity when her family attended a synagogue

*I may have very few good traits, but one trait which I do possess is my inability to imitate anyone else. I always want to be myself and to display my unique dignity of having been created in the image of God. The glory of the individual is exemplified by the singularity of every human being. This concept is the motto of my life. . . .*

\_. . . I do not like to do what others can do better or just as well. I wish to do that which I am unique at! This is not an expression of haughtiness; no, it is a fulfillment of my intrinsic human dignity and individuality.\_7
