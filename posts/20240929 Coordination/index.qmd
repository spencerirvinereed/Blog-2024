A big part of celebration, in old Korea, was food.

And it continues to be.

The role of taste coordinators is uniquely important.

Combining food from various sources, and output of many helping hands, yet making the outcome as if a single person prepared them

According to my paternal cousins, my mom was one, as others in her family were.

They carried on that important tradition.

Now days, we have event coordinators.

Planning and coordinating events that are considered `too important to fail.`

Are we over planning?

Are we letting God be part of that planning?

If the event is considered a failure, who do we blame?

If the event is a success who do we thank?

We have a life coordinators, us and God.

Seemingly, when we think we are in charge, we are not.

When we are not ready to be in charge, we are put in charge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about life coordinators.

Partnership with God.

Plan much as possible but allow for some surprises and unexpected outcome.

What are those things that give us a glimpse of the next life?
