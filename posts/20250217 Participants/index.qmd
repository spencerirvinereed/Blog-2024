When taking meeting minutes, I keep a section called participants.

Remembering earlier days when the attendance was taken, when the name was called, one would answer,

> Present!

There are tools or software that will capture what has happened.

Things to be worked on, things being worked on, a few tasks that are actually completed.

Imagine, many of the meeting notes will be same, in other companies, across the industry.

Until we develop robots or AIs that will take my place at work, I will attend meetings and associate with others, and note of what I ought to be working on, until the next gathering.

Growing up, we watched a certain movie during the winter holidays.

A young man, in a small town, grows up and wants to leave the town and fulfill his big ambitions. But due to his father's sudden illness and death, he takes over the family business and stays home.

He marries his high school sweetheart, and they build and realize their dreams. He still has dreams of travelling but his dreams are curtailed as he grows older. He volunteers during the war and holds the town together during financial crisis.

Then on a pivotal Christmas Eve, his forgetful uncle loses the cash deposit^[about $140,000 in today's money] that will continue to fund his small Building and Loan (a modern day credit union)

Desperately, he re-traces his uncle's path and finally, meets with the only person in town, who could bail him out.

The cold-hearted person, says, the inspectors are at his place and will find him guilty of embezzlement and will lock him up.

He winds up on the bridge, as the snow covers the surrouding. He contemplates, jumping off the bridge.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The story has a wonderful ending.

A messenger from God, an angel is dispatched to save him. By showing him, what his life would have been like had he not been born. Or had he not participated, involved in people's lives.

The movie closes with town folks and his immediate family gathering. Collecting funds that will cover the loss. Reminding the hero that he played a significant role in people's lives.

Indeed, he is the richest person in town.^[a summary of the movie, `It's a Wonderful Life`, 1946]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not many meeting minutes will be remembered. Nor why we held and attended so many meetings.

However, because we attended certain events and we participated, we felt certain changes.

When others extend a genuine concern, willingness to work without ranks or who gets the credit.

Doing what is asked, because we committed to it, or it is the right thing to do.

Those, will be captured as personal memories and remembered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Live in a town that people come for education and career advancement. Many leave, searching for their next challenges. It is great when some of them return and visit.

Revisiting past events and recalling people that were nearly forgotten. Reminding us that we were once young and had dreams and goals.

So I will continue to pursue that goal in life.

Participating fully in life, whether that means, voluntary or involuntary. Because, when life is reviewed, evidences overwhelmingly support Peter's declaration

> "In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed."

-   1 Peter 1:6-7 (NIV)
