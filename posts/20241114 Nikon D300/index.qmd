## How it became mine

Source was KSL.com

The gentleman selling said there was an issue with auto-focus.

Included Nikkor 18-70 Zoom lens and battery pack MB-D10

Solid build, too many controls to learn easily.

Uses CF

Was \$1800 back in 2007, over \$2600 now days

## Things I Learned

auto focus mode, whole screen optimized vs. smaller area.
