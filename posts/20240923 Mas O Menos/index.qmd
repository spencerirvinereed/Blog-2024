City of Incheon has a park named 자유공원 (Freedom Park).

<https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Poa7w9rvUR5GLCA9>

Have visited since I was young

It was scary place to visit with a massive statue of Douglas McArthur.

It was only place to visit.

I took many photos there,

Went back for a visit some 40 years afterwards

The place looked small.

What changed?

My awareness.

Having visited other places.

My confidence in front of men increased.

Edifices that seemed big seems to grow smaller, upon return visits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a period when I tried to measure and document all things around me.

Steps taken, amount of rain,

Ancients didn't

What is the difference?
