When one lives in a small town for several decades, chances of meeting acquaintances in public place increase each year.

More rare but welcomed is a visit by people that used to live but no longer.

The place we have chosen to live undergoes a turnover in residents.

Due to 2 large universities.

`r 34000 / 4` in one

`r 40000 / 4` in another

Reminder that we were younger and they remembered.
Hope for the future.

The texter knew Sister K's maiden name. She hadn't used that name in decades.

Check of the caller's Area Code indicated, it might be part of a scam.

Then the texter shared his name. It was a friend from Korea days, nearly 25 years earlier, 채희곤.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sister K and I spent the first 3 years of married life in a Student Housing Apartments.

Even though, the one bedroom is designated as "Max Occupants: 2", we lived in the one-bedroom apt longer than the 2 bedroom version.

Only when the 2nd child was on his way, we moved to a bigger apartment.

Then with help from parents, we purchased our first home in the Indian Hills area of Provo.

We moved in few days before Christmas. It seems like it snowed a lot more back in those days.

I remembers, next door neighbors[^2], came and sang Christmas Carols for us.

There was an empty lot to the south of the house.Children often played in the grassed area.The lot was owned by Stephen Fletcher (1911\~2008), a prominent lawyer with both Chesapeak & Potomac Telephone and AT&T.[^3]

During the time I knew him, he was in his 80s.

Still vibrant, spent a lot his time taking care of the lot.He mentioned how much he enjoyed watching the sun set over the Utah Lake.

(The lot remained empty until his passing)

We got to be friends with their son Bill and his wife Maureen.

They had 3 sons, Dan, John and Josh. (they had a daughter later, Katie)

We also got to know Olsens, Greg and Sydney. Greg became famous painter of Christian themes.

Their son, Nathan, alerted adults when Sister K needed immediate medical attention.

First ones to respond and take her to the hospital were the Lunds, Steven and Kalleen.

This was before the days of cell phones and Nate Olsen's quick action saved Sister K and the baby.

We would spend 6 years in the Edgemont 8th Ward neighborhood. One more son would join the family.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then within a week, we would run into Lunds at a DIY Home Improvement Center.

They looked same as before.I felt like I have aged a lot.

They still recognized us and checked on the family

In a similar way we were able to get caught up on Korean friends through 채희곤.

Learned he had served in the same mission, LA Mission, with many other Koreans that we knew.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being recognized and recognizing others.A basic part of life.

It is a blessing to recall and remember a time together.

A simpler, slower time in life.

Be able to express appreciation for being a friend.

Old friends are great because they not only brings back memories but they also remind us who we were.
