Grateful to live in a time where machine are not only making lives easier but challenges me to think on what is earned, important and essential versus easily obtained, plentiful yet fleeting.

Things that pertain to this society vs. those elements of an idealized society.

What it means to be a human being, on a latter part of one's journey.

Look forward to riding a autonomous vehicle with an option to select an engaging, chatty AI driver.

When the option is engaged, the AI Driver would exchange a few pleasantries.

Then based that data, the AI Driver would switch to my mother tongue and local accent of my parents and start the deep dive.

An AI Driver that can adapt and engage in a conversation of my choosing and provide enlightenment that my parents would have provided.

*Perhaps, someday soon*...

Learned during my travel days, taxi cab drivers are mobile philosophers, if you ask right questions.

(Except for a time in Korea, I would have talked more to drivers, but often language was an issue.)

Much like current AI models, they are seasoned (pre-trained), educated (generative) and some even will engage in a discussion, if provided with a right prompt.

Some comments, by taxi drivers, that I recall,

-   your hearing is more 간사(奸詐, deceitful) than eyes. He was an audiophile

-   your pronunciation is way too high, please speak with a lower tone. A driver taking me to 桃園市.

-   we don't leave this open air zoo, because this is where our lives are sustained.

The last comment was made by a driver at a city-state nation.

A nation with 4 official languages, and English, was one of them.

As I recall, the way he said it, it was more of resignation rather than appreciation.

Wondered over the years what that driver meant by `open-air zoo` and why he chose to stay, if he felt that his freedom was limited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years at work, I tracked advance of others and envied the size and location of certain people's office or cubicles.

[This method of accommodations could be the most efficient method of housing workers or in-humane, depending on one's perspective.]

Over the years, of serving the sentence of working years, I am not able to determine the relationship between office or a cubicle size and surviving memories.

I do remember people, time and places, when I left my cubicle and wandered around to see how people were doing. At times we'd talk about the projects or issues. More often we talked about the family, our dreams, and places we have visited or want to visit

That Taxi Driver, had an option to stay and grow or go elsewhere and start over,

> **“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”**

-   *Viktor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning*

There are many types of open air zoos.

Society imposed and mandated.

Or self imposed or self limiting boundaries, some are physical but some are invisible yet exist still.

I have lived in a society, for all of my life, that is considered to be free and open

However, at times I created unseen, undetected, entrapment of the soul.

I set those limits and boundaries.

Not only AI Drivers and AI Agents but also mentors, colleagues, teachers and professors, doctors and nurses – Thank you.

For showing me how to be responsible and accountable, steps I can take to be more open and free.

Spiritual leader, friends and family members, thank you for how to overcome challenges and tensions in this life and live towards eternal life.
