The conductor of the meeting said that the mother of the speaker had set a new church record.

The record for travelling longest to listen to her daughter speak at a church meeting. (She had flown nearly 6000 miles)

This congregation is represented by people from many continents and countries. Germany, Peru, India, China, Taiwan, Korea, and South Africa, among others.

We had grown accustomed to people from above countries speaking English with ease. Their parent's generation, as I recall, spoke with accent and their speech was not as fluid.

The chosen speaker, mentioned that she was better known as a daughter-in-law, and the wife. And that this is the longest time she had spoken at the church.

As she settled into her talk, her English didn't sound like someone who had lived in America for only 3 years.

While in her home country, her scholarship was revoked when she indicated that she would be serving a 18-month mission.

Her mission was to Salt Lake City Temple Square.

That explained partly why her English sounded like a native.

While she was serving, she took part in answering questions from online investigators.

A young man she was helping had many questions. She tried her best to answer his questions but each time she answered he seemed to have many more.

Eventually some of his questions began to effect her and she started having questions of her own.

She prayed and asked for how to best help him, as well as answers to her own questions.

She then realized that it wasn't her role to answer his every question. But rather, she was to bring him closer to Christ. And then he would be able to answer his own questions. (In turn, her questions would melt away)

> What did she lose/gain by serving a mission, in the short-term or temporal and in the long-term and eternal sense.

She had understood early, the teaching found in Matthew 6:33.

> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well
>
> (NIV, v. 33)

As she was speaking, thought about the wealth of a nation.

> How do we assess country or society's wealth?

AI Prompt lists over a dozen indicators, covering economic, financial, and social aspects. Including, GDP, PPP, National Debt, Resource Reserves, and Education and Skill Levels. See, @sec-AI

While these are well used and effective in comparing nations, there is a more simple metric, that is a better predictor or indicator.

It is the collective experience and wisdom of a group, as well as their commitment and covenant to each other and to God.

This will ensure that the family and neighborhood are strong, which in turn, will result in a prosperous nation.

None of the people that were attending the church that day were coerced in any manner.

They came, young and old, especially the older people made their way through the snow and was in attendance, filling up the front part of the chapel.

(The snow was cleared, as if by magic, by volunteers).

It was delightful to hear the next generation, a foreign born speaker, articulate and speak in a manner that was indistinguishable from native speakers.

They are indeed a blessed and a chosen generation, living in a neighborhood that seeks to be a Zion Society.

Assessing a nation's wealth requires considering various economic, financial, and social indicators. Here are key ways to measure it:

### **1. Economic Indicators**

-   **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** – The total value of goods and services produced within a country.
-   **GDP per Capita** – GDP divided by population, providing an average economic output per person.
-   **Gross National Income (GNI)** – GDP plus income from abroad (remittances, foreign investments).
-   **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** – Adjusts GDP per capita to reflect differences in cost of living.

### **2. Financial Indicators**

-   **National Debt** – The total government debt relative to GDP.
-   **Foreign Exchange Reserves** – A country’s holdings of foreign currency and gold.
-   **Trade Balance** – The difference between exports and imports; a trade surplus suggests a stronger economy.
-   **Investment & Savings Rates** – High levels of domestic savings and investments contribute to long-term wealth.

### **3. Natural Resource Wealth**

-   **Resource Reserves** – The value of natural resources (oil, minerals, forests, etc.).
-   **Agricultural Productivity** – A strong agricultural sector adds to national wealth.

### **4. Infrastructure & Industrial Base**

-   **Manufacturing & Innovation Capacity** – Countries with strong industries and research capabilities tend to accumulate wealth.
-   **Transportation & Energy Infrastructure** – Well-developed infrastructure supports economic growth.

### **5. Human Capital**

-   **Education & Skill Levels** – A highly skilled workforce increases productivity.
-   **Healthcare & Life Expectancy** – A healthy population is more productive and less of a financial burden.

### **6. Quality of Life & Societal Wealth**

-   **Income Distribution (Gini Coefficient)** – Measures economic inequality.
-   **Human Development Index (HDI)** – Considers life expectancy, education, and income levels.
-   **Happiness & Well-being Metrics** – Some nations assess wealth beyond money, considering quality of life.

### **7. Technological & Digital Economy**

-   **Innovation & Patents** – More patents indicate technological advancement.
-   **Internet & Digital Infrastructure** – Strong digital economy contributes to wealth accumulation.
