Sister K and I have a daily stand-up, or more accurately a daily-walk meeting.\
We spend 30 minutes to an hour of uninterrupted time in the canyon.

We discuss what we learned, felt, and what we hope to accomplish during the hike/meeting. I mostly listen, working on a skill that I should have learned a long time ago. There are no distractions or worldly influences, unless having a non-carrier phone as a camera is considered a distration.

We often take a break to see the cloud patterns or predict the day's weather based on the wind pattern. We adjust our meeting schedule to accommodate the rotation of the earth around the sun and the resulting changes to sun (moon) rise timetable

It has become a daily practice or routine for Sister K and I

When the job is 30+ miles (50km) away and the region is expanding, one can spend couple hours on the road. Often the public transportation seemed more civilized, even though it added an additional hour to the rigor.

That had been my lot for the vast majority of my adult life. Even when I was overseas my commute was at least an hour each way.

I've listened to my fair share of audiobooks and conference talks on a number of electronic devices. Learned to make those hours somewhat productive but still I didn't get to spend that time at home. Away from my primary duties and the role.

Then two years ago an opportunity came up that reduced my commute time by 75%.\
I joined a company 7 miles from home. Initially, instead of taking the 7AM FrontRunner, I took the time to catch up on social media generated happenings.

I wasn't taking advantage of the time allotted me. I needed a new way of starting a day.

I began by visiting nearby hills. Initial few days or weeks were bit difficult. After that adjustment period, the routine became part of my life

It became a time to reflect, a time for gratitude, and a time for renewing. And the bonus of a physical exercise.

I've been invited Sister K to join me

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I told Sister K a few days ago,

> thanks for coming each day for the hike and the exercise

she replied

> oh it's not for the exercise I come up here, it is to commune

so I gave up commute and replaced it with a commune which dictionary defines as

> share one's intimate thoughts or feelings with (someone), especially on a spiritual level. e.g. "the purpose of praying is to commune with God"
