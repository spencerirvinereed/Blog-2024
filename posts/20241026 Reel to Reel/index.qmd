Bought a 10 inch reel to reel machine from Max Cannon. He was offering a fully functioning machine plus 2 dozen aluminum reel to reels with classic music. Fully indexed.

He asked for a modest price. About 2 reel to reels for the whole collection.

I offered 2 times what he was asking.

He seemed bit surprised but he accepted.

Nearly 20 years afterwards, I reopened his gift.

Took a little getting used to. Muscle memory was gone. Had to relearn how to thread.

After some cleaning with alcohol and swabs, turned on the machine.

The motor turned too fast.

Couldn't figure out what was wrong.

I was ready to call the local repair shop.

Then the good sound kicked in. What a glorious room filling warm sound

I can understand why people want this kind of sound in their homes.

Some effort but well worth it.
