My parents bought their retirement home 6 years prior to moving into it.

They had lived in the Washington DC suburb for 30 years.

Their friends in the church and their Korean friends were there.

As they approached 80 years of age, they made the decision to move near us.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the last 7 years we shared in the living arrangement.

Mom and Dad lived upstairs and Sister K and I lived downstairs.

We shared many meals and memories together.

Although they were independent till the end, they benefited emotionally - having us there.

Their home was built on an incline.

The yard on the east side was higher than the west.

If my mom stood on the west-end window, she could look out onto the North-South Street.

Often, she would knock on the window, as I left for work, I would wave back in acknowledgement.

Like most modern windows, this one was sealed from the beginning.

No words were exchanged but a communication had taken place.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few days ago, I also looked out the same window, as my son drove away.

He heard my knocking and waved back.

We acknowledged one another, a new cycle had begun.

As most people age, they long to be with their parents again.

Especially during holidays and special occasions, this longing is acute.

Today was one of those days.

*(Let my song ride the breeze,\
To part the curtains of your window.)*

Once in a while, it would be nice to open up the window or the veil between and hear my parents' voice or knocking/prompting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the gathered group were departing, I overheard a voice,

> As I age, my appreciation for my parents grow...

In agreement and I love and appreciate my parents even more.
