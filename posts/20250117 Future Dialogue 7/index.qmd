**손자(孫子):**

Please tell me how you and grandma met and how you decided to marry her.

**Older Me:**

Didn't your mom tell you already, I thought everyone heard it at least once.

**손자(孫子):**

But it gets better each time you tell it, with some embellishment or enhancements.

Besides, I am dating this girl and I want to see if there are some similar patterns and if there are principles that still apply.

**Older Me:**

Fair enough, but remember the authoritative version is with your Grandma.

Long long ago, some 50 years ago, before the Internet, before cell phones, before the term virtual existed, I had returned home from my mission -- in August.

Grandma Hong was preparing to serve her mission in December -- to the same mission with the same mission president.

**손자(孫子):**

Is that why President Campbell later called the wedding the `“Hong-Kang”` wedding of the year?

**Older Me:**

He was a much better mission president than a meme creator.

I had seen grandma many times and had a feeling that I should date her.

I kept putting off that feeling.

Then I saw her at her farewell gathering.

I really noticed the glow about her that time and I made up my mind to date and court her.

Some called it the one of the “New 7 Wonders”, that she and I got married.

**손자(孫子):**

Why so, were you that different back then.

You two are almost indistinguishable in your thought and behavior now.

In fact, there is no sense in trying to get you to disagree on some things.

**Older Me:**

It wasn’t always that way.

Because I was selfish, impatient, and stubborn.

**손자(孫子):**

Whoa, I wasn’t expecting this to be a Confession-from-Grandpa meeting.

So what made you want to change?

**Older Me:**

I knew I had to give up certain traits to become a better person, or a follower of Christ.

But mainly pride and incorrect traditions about how to be a man prevented me from changing initially -- before the marriage.

After marriage and raising children, mainly your grandma, your mom, your uncles, along with church callings and the roles I had on my job, prompted and helped me to change and I did, although it took a great deal longer than it should have.

**손자(孫子):**

So it was a combination of passage of time and experiences that made you a better person, a better suitor, and a father/husband.

Anything else?

**Older Me:**

We found out that we both read, Preparing for Celestial Marriage Course Book. [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/preparing-for-an-eternal-marriage?lang=eng)

It contained many of the principles that one should understand and apply not only in marriage but also during courtship and how to lead a life in general. 

But it is a theory, and it doesn't belong to you, and is a concept until you test its truthfulness by applying it.

**손자(孫子):**

Well that is what I am about to do.

Now days we call that manual, “How to prepare myself first - for the Eternal Marriage”

What about 七転び八起きstory that uncle told me about.

**Older Me:**

Oh yes, Grandma is a gentle person, but she can be tough, even mean when she wants/has to be.

She turned me down 7 times before granting me a first date.

She let me know that I had to prove myself and that I valued friendship and courtship, and ultimately that I am committed to a relationship and the institution called the Marriage and Family.

**손자(孫子):**

So was it a destiny (운명) or chance (우현) that you met, dated and courted her.

**Older Me:**

It was a chance, a very slim one at that, that we met. 

But we turned it into a destiny by working on our dissimilarities and by building upon our common heritage and relying on faith and guidance from above.

**손자(孫子):**

Lastly, how did you know she was the person you wanted to marry

**Older Me:**

I was attracted to how she handled herself with grace and how beautiful she looked, seemingly without really trying -- I saw the glow about her. 

Also how she was viewed by others and her standing with her peers, she was universally loved and praised.

Each time we met we felt peace, we were not in a rush, we didn’t have to prove anything to one another.

It was like we had a whole lifetime and an eternity to learn things, to grow and share things, and to love another.

Naturally I wanted to keep that for myself and when I asked her to build a family together, she accepted.

**손자(孫子):**

First time or after 7 tries?
