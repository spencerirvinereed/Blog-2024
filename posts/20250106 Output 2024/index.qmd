During 2024 I created 85 possible blog entries in one Project, that I labelled Attitudes & Longings.

In additions, I have 2 other Projects.

Kang and Hwang Family History.

Tails from Trails.

From those projects, I posted 37 times to FB.

I have 359 friends on Facebook.

I probably started 3 to 5 times that figure in my head, on paper, on Obsidian and in R-Studio version of Quarto.

What have I gained?

Has anything changed?

A lot and and YES, my view of the situation is sharpening.
