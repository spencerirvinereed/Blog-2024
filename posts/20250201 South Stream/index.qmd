Directly south of the largest private, religious university by enrollment, there is a pathway.

This trail follows a stream for about 1.5 里 (0.5 miles) starting at LSB and ending at RB.

For the first 1000 feet, heading due West, the pathway runs parallel to both 8th Street and South Campus Drive, passing the Duck Pond and stairs to the campus (at 2nd and 4th Avenues).

There are waterfalls and rest areas along the way. A part of renovation, completed in April, 2011.[^1]

Then at the stairs that lead to MSRB, the path takes a hair pin turn and turns toward the North East (東北) direction.

More mature trees and waterfalls adorn this part of the trail with access to southern part of the campus.

This pathway does not provide direct access any of the well-utilized buildings on the Campus.

But it does provide a buffer, a greenbelt.[^2]

Also a time to reflect on life, as one descends into the living area, from taking another beating at the Grant Building a.k.a the Testing Center.

According to David Johnson, in the April 2006 Daily Universe article, a scholar, a teacher, and a defender of faith, lived near this pathway, in a little gray house.[^3].

Both Sister K and I met this person on the Campus Stream. Sister K recalls his manner of dress, like a farmer, with a hat and an overall.

He would have been in his mid-70s.

(when the work or the office is within a walking distance and use a less-traveled pathway, one can dress in the most comfortable manner)

A story from his life, includes this tidbit.[^4]

> Two of his colleagues related stories of [him] contributing to a church collection to buy a new overcoat for someone, not realizing that the person was him.

Wonder how much inspiration he drew from his walk near his home, along the stream, on an 10 minute hike along the trail.

-   how many thoughts and ideas passed through his minds, how many were captured, how many were lost.
-   did he re-consider his past decisions, or was he always walking with God.
-   did he think through his legacy or was he always living in the present, letting the world and his family propagate his knowledge and develop a legacy.

Grateful to live in an area that is a home to an academic institution and an access to nature. Carefully cultivated and maintained setting to develop leaders for the present society and future generations.

The other, reminding us that universe is ever growing and there is room aplenty.

Of the many writings and speeches by that scholar, teach, and defender of faith, perhaps this is most accessible and applicable.^[<https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/hugh-nibley/leaders-managers/]

> Leaders are movers and shakers, original, inventive, unpredictable, imaginative, full of surprises that discomfit the enemy in war and the main office in peace. For managers are safe, conservative, predictable, conforming organization men and team players, dedicated to the establishment.
