Heard from Grandma K today, what is this voter initiative you started back in 2025?

**Older Me:**

I felt that we needed more time to reflect as a people. So I proposed that we make every weekend in February a 3-day weekend.

**손자(孫子):**

Wow, a surprising idea, coming from you. How did you get the idea?

**Older Me:**

Two things, snow and confusion. Where I lived, February is the snowiest month and some people were spending an inordinate amount of time to get to and from work. And I could not remember if the current designated holiday was the 2nd or 3rd Monday of the month.

In addition, there are number of sporting events and traditional holidays that would benefit.

**손자(孫子):**

Oh I see, like the Super Bowl, and spring festival, 春節. So how did it turn out?

**Older Me:**

People like the idea, we got a few thousand signatures and some of the city councilman and state representatives supported the idea. However, the industry leaders were firmly against it and it was quickly tabled.

**손자(孫子):**

So you gave up?

**Older Me:**

Not so fast, next year I proposed another initiative called the `Sabbatical Month`

> A **sabbatical** is an extended break from work, typically lasting from a few months to a year, allowing individuals to **rest, research, travel, or focus on personal growth**. It is most common in **academia, corporate jobs, and creative fields**.

People were free to take the whole month of February to pursue their needs or interests.

**손자(孫子):**

You mean one could pursue courtship that will result in a June, July or August wedding?

What would older people do with all that time?

**Older Me:**

Joel 2:28

> And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions

I felt that we were surrounded by too many voices, distractions and we weren't receiving necessary messages as well as needed connection with our roots, family and nature.

**손자(孫子):**

So month of reflections and reconnections for the older people. And for the young people, a month of courtship or love?

I love the idea.

I suppose it didn't get far either.

**Older Me:**

No, but it got people thinking and some chose to take PTOs (Personal Time Off) to visit their homes for more than a weekend. To take care of their old folks. Make amends with old friends, and visit places without modern offerings.

And the young people pursued courtship with a vigor.

**손자(孫子):**

Is this when you got the idea for that short story you wrote?

**Older Me:**

Yes, as I was walking, on a National Holiday afternoon, noticed a fallen tree with its inside hollowed out. Yet, on the outside a fresh set of moss was growing. All around there was snow and fallen leaves to provide nutrients.

This cycle has repeated and will continue on. What I saw that day took years, perhaps decades in the making. The mountains are much older.

Yet man can alter or even destroy the natural order of things.

Similarly, man have evolved and changed. We don't even know the path they took. Yet we make a determination in matter of fraction of second.

We should take as much time to appreciate the nature as our schedule allows. In the same manner, we need to the necessary time to understand one another.

**손자(孫子):**

OK, Grandpa, I need to go pick up my date. Any last thoughts?

**Older Me:**

When we moved from agrarian to industrial society, we lost something significant. Attachment to and dependence on nature and higher beings.

Just because we can work constantly and think continuously, we shouldn't We should pause take time for ourselves -- reflect So that we can, independent of technology, see visions and dream dreams.

**손자(孫子):**

Gotta run.

Always good talking to you.

Look forward to following up on that last thought
