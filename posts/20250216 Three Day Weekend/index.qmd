Photos in my posts tend to be that of sun sets.

Both sunrises and sunsets at 40 degrees north latitudes are predictable.

But for vast majority of my working life, I was on the bus or train, when the sun rose over the Wasatch mountains

The morning sunrise has same glow as the sunset, not there to see it.

Would there be more sunset or sunrise photos if I retire?

What I have to do vs. What I want to do.

What if when everyday is a Saturday or Sunday?

Those few minutes of sunrise or sunset was special because, made time and planned for it, and hoped for it [Spencer Kimball last message]

We make time for things that are valuable.

What about our parents, did they not have their own dreams.
I don't know if they had their bucket list.
Other than hoping and wishing for the sucess of the next generation

How do we make plans for those that are most worthwhile in this life.

Throughout our lives, it is 6 days of labor and one day of service.
In retirement, it is 6 days of your interest.
Followed by one day of worship, if you follow the Christian/Judeo faith.

Spencer Kimball gave this, his last public message, on April 1982
He was 87 and in poor health.

He said, 

> I have waited for this day and hoped for it and believed for it.

He continued

> So as I express that love for you and for the memory of the great experiences Iâ€™ve had with you, I bear my testimony: this work is divine, the Lord is at the helm, the Church is true, and all is well. God bless you, brothers and sisters, I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

Likewise,

When all places are overrun by tourists, what will be that special locale.
