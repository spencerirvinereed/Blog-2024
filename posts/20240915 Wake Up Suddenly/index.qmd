Perhaps Billy Ocean said it best during the 80s.

> ...wake up, and suddenly you're in love 

Having lived in the same area for nearly 4 decades one would not expect the change in seasons each year seems to sneak up

And know that the change from summer to fall is not only inevitable it's to be expected and welcomed.

At times, I'm lulled into thinking there are actually two seasons summer and winter
And both will last nearly all year long

Patterns and changes in our lives, also seem to reflect and mirror the progression of seasons 

There is a saying in Korea. when young, you purchase (invest in) experience

>젊어서는 고생도 산다

Similarly, when you leave home expect expect hardship.

Pursuing adventure and tolerating hardship takes backseat as one ages.

Seeking more comfort and security

## Days of Wandering

For the first 35 years of my life, only overseas trip consisted of leaving my home country as a pre-teenager
And returning to it to meet Sister K's family following our marriage as a mid-20 year old.

Leaving home to pursue adventure abroad and learn lessons via hardship began when I turned 35 years old. 

Except in my case, my employers paid for my lessons abroad.

- Could I have had those without leaving the comforts of home?
- Was I ready for those lessons?
- What changed, within me, as a result of those encounters?

## Local Training: Led by Neighbors

I attend a bi-monthly training session with my neighbors.
These meetings can be a life transforming meeting or fleeting as a change of season in Utah -- depending on one's preparation and frame of mind.

Held on Sunday morning, led by a neighbor and participated by a diverse group of men ranging in age from early 20s to mid 90s

During a recent discussion, following principle was presented

>The temple is the gateway to the greatest blessings God has in store for each of us, for the temple is the only place on earth where we may receive all of the blessings promised to Abraham.

Russell M. Nelson, April 2024 [Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/57nelson?lang=eng)

As a group, we reviewed keys restored at the time of Kirtland Temple Dedication.

- Keys of Gathering - Through Moses
- Gospel of Abraham - Through Esaias
- Keys of Sealing - Through Elijah

Then the discussion leader introduced us into the world of Gilgamesh Epic
Specifically, the role of Utnapishtim, as a character who possesses the secret to immortality.

Realized that many familiar biblical accounts are representation of temples.

Ark came to rest on the top of the mountain. 
Dimensions and levels of ark are similiar to construction of temples.

Highest levels of temples (ark) represents the presence of God.

Moses tried to usher the people into the presence of God

>24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.

- D&C 84

Representations of temples can be found and experienced in nearly all places and at all times.

We visit remnants of temples and preserved and restored temples, built by ancients.

- There is an entrance, at a level accessible to inhabitants of the area.
- The guiding path leads visitors and locals to various man-made edifices that represent, experiences, wishes, events, or promises made and kept.
- The temple journey continues upward, until reaching the Main Hall (본관^[Depending on the chosen characters, it can mean the main hall (本館) or the place of origin (本貫)]).

Likewise, climbing a mountain may contain all of the above, represented by God-made, God-placed, God-planned reminders.  The goal is the summit.

The Main Hall or the Summit represent the presence of God, our goal.

These, along with many others, are reminders and invitations that show us that we are living in a temporary home and we need to seek out and return to our original home.

>Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
there's beauty up above
and things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

# Appendix

## Lessons from Gilgamesh Epic

The **Epic of Gilgamesh**, one of the earliest known works of literature, offers several important lessons:

1. **The Quest for Immortality**: Gilgamesh's journey to find eternal life is a central theme. He learns that immortality is unattainable for humans and that one should focus on the legacy they leave behind, rather than fearing death. This teaches us about accepting mortality and finding meaning in life itself.

2. **Friendship and Compassion**: The deep bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu shows the power of friendship to change and improve individuals. Gilgamesh's transformation after Enkidu’s death highlights how relationships shape our character and understanding of the world.

3. **The Limits of Power**: As a king, Gilgamesh starts as a tyrant, but through his trials, he realizes that power alone cannot fulfill one's life. His growth into a wise and just ruler underscores the value of humility and self-awareness.

4. **The Inevitability of Suffering**: Both Gilgamesh and Enkidu face loss, hardship, and grief, showing that suffering is an inescapable part of life. How one responds to it defines their character.

5. **Human Connection to Nature**: Enkidu, initially a wild man, represents the balance between civilization and nature. His journey and eventual domestication reflect the importance of respecting the natural world and finding harmony between human society and the environment.

The Epic of Gilgamesh offers timeless wisdom about human nature, life, and death.


## Summary of Immortality Narrative in the Epic

In the immortality narrative of the Epic of Gilgamesh, after the death of his close friend Enkidu, Gilgamesh is consumed by the fear of his own mortality. Determined to escape death, he embarks on a quest to find Utnapishtim, a man who was granted immortality by the gods after surviving a great flood.

When Gilgamesh finally meets Utnapishtim, he learns that immortality is a gift that cannot be achieved by effort or desire, but is given by the gods under special circumstances. Utnapishtim recounts how he and his wife were made immortal as a reward for preserving life during the flood, but tells Gilgamesh that this fate is not for everyone.

Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights to prove his worthiness, but Gilgamesh fails. He is then told about a plant that can restore youth, which Gilgamesh retrieves, but it is stolen by a snake while he bathes, leaving him with nothing.

In the end, Gilgamesh returns to his city of Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond human reach. Instead, he learns that his true legacy lies in the achievements of his life, particularly in the enduring works he builds for his people, such as the city's walls. The narrative teaches that while physical immortality is unattainable, one can achieve a form of immortality through their deeds and contributions to society.

## Layout and Patterns of Buddhist Temples

The layout and pattern of Buddhist temples vary by region, but there are common elements and principles rooted in Buddhist cosmology, spiritual practice, and local architectural traditions. Here’s a general overview of the typical layout and structure of a Buddhist temple:

### 1. **Orientation**
   - **Cardinal Directions**: Temples are often aligned with cardinal directions, especially facing east, symbolizing the Buddha’s enlightenment and the rising sun.
   - **Symmetry**: Temples often follow a symmetrical layout, reflecting balance and harmony, which are key principles in Buddhism.

### 2. **Main Components of a Buddhist Temple**
   
#### 2.1 **Entrance (Torana or Gate)**
   - The entrance to a Buddhist temple is usually marked by a **gate** or **torana**, often elaborately decorated. It signifies the passage from the secular world to the sacred.

#### 2.2 **Stupa (Pagoda in East Asia)**
   - **Stupas** are dome-like structures that hold relics, usually of the Buddha or other important monks. They are central features of many Buddhist temples.
   - The **stupa** represents the mind of the Buddha and the universe, symbolizing enlightenment. It is often surrounded by circumambulation paths, where devotees walk in a clockwise direction as a form of meditation or prayer.

#### 2.3 **Main Hall (Vihara, Wat, or Daibutsuden)**
   - The main hall houses statues of the Buddha and is the primary place of worship.
   - It may include:
     - **Seated Buddha statue**: Symbolizing meditation and enlightenment.
     - **Standing Buddha statue**: Representing the Buddha’s teachings and blessing.
     - **Reclining Buddha statue**: Symbolizing the Buddha's passing into nirvana.
   - In many East Asian temples, the main hall is called the **Daibutsuden** (Great Buddha Hall) or **Main Shrine Hall**.

#### 2.4 **Meditation Halls (Zendo or Dhyana Hall)**
   - Temples often include a meditation hall, where monks and practitioners engage in meditation practices.
   - The layout is simple and serene to promote focus.

#### 2.5 **Monastic Quarters (Vihara)**
   - Buddhist temples often include **monastic living quarters** for monks and nuns, usually located near or within the temple complex.

#### 2.6 **Prayer Wheels or Prayer Flags (Tibetan Temples)**
   - In Tibetan Buddhist temples, you might find **prayer wheels** filled with mantras or **prayer flags** flying in the wind. These symbolize the spreading of good karma and blessings.

#### 2.7 **Courtyard**
   - Many temples have open courtyards that provide a serene space for contemplation. Courtyards often contain gardens, trees, and sometimes ponds, reflecting the natural world and the impermanence of life.

### 3. **Architectural Style Variations**
   - **Indian Subcontinent**: Simple, rock-cut caves like those found in Ajanta or Ellora; stupas like the Great Stupa at Sanchi.
   - **Southeast Asia**: Tiered roofs, vibrant colors, and spires are common in temples like Thailand’s **Wat Phra Kaew** or Myanmar’s **Shwedagon Pagoda**.
   - **China and Japan**: Wooden pagodas with sloping roofs, such as **Todaiji** in Japan or **Leshan Giant Buddha** in China.
   - **Tibet**: Thick walls, golden roofs, prayer wheels, and intricate murals, as seen in the **Potala Palace** or **Jokhang Temple**.

### 4. **Symbolism in the Design**
   - **Stupa Structure**: The stupa is usually designed to represent the elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, culminating in a central point symbolizing nirvana.
   - **Lotus Motif**: The lotus flower, representing purity and enlightenment, is commonly depicted in temple architecture.
   - **Mandala Layout**: Some temples are laid out in the pattern of a **mandala**, a spiritual symbol representing the universe in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
