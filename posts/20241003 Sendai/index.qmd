2nd Day took us to Sendai and beyond.
Initially thought of re-visiting Yamadera 山寺

However, decided to do something my travelling partner wanted to do.

Go to (温泉) onsen, instead.

Chose Sakunami, specifically Ichinobo, along the Senzan line, that run between Sendai and Yamagata
The onsen is about 3.5 km from the station.

We wound up statying at Yunohara instead.
