A long road home

How do we find our way home without a guide.
How do we differentiate between truth and error.

Years ago my cousin bought me a packet of 5 cassettes containing Korean Lyric songs.
Each cassette contained about 22.5 to 25 minutes of music.
All music was good, in particular tape 4.
Made a copy of that tape.

I was finishing the hike
Home stretch.
A group of 5 or 6 were starting theirs.

One of them looked up and said,
Hey Bishop

I looked and recognized him as the elder that served in the Ward then sent to Japan with 6 months left.
I searched in my memory for his name
then it came

Elder Fong

taking the lull during the football game I was next in line to get the gas and then I get a phone call how Bishop are you getting a gas at Costco it was familiar face conveyor now I need to be aware that I'm being watched

The term is former Bishop is it better to say previous Bishop in any case is honored to be called a bishop serving

For 5 years, I met with young people (18-30 years old), each Sunday on the campus.
(Visited that congregation of believers that I had associated with for 5 years.)

Yesterday, I returned for a visit, after a 16 month hiatus

Took an advantage of an ideal fall weather and walked 
One can wear a coat and still be comfortable.

Walk took longer than expected.
A leisurely walk rate over 2 miles took over an hour.

Time to take some photos of changing leaf color.



Arrived when the first Ward got out.

I was to meet for the 2nd Ward.

\

Worried that most people won’t recognize me.
If they did recognize me, what would i talk about after 1.5 year absence.
Worries were in vain


Recognized many and in turn many recognized me and stopped to visit.
Words and expressions were shared without much effort.

Realized how I missed this friendship.
The level of teaching or delivery was superb.


Felt the spirit.
Heard Jenny Koh speak on her mission
\

Hearing Ben’s testimony was great.
Bishop Lee was bishop like.

\

I was utterly the former Bishop this day.

I thoroughly enjoyed it.
