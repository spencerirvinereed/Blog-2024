Defying the advice of a well known expression, 一度も登らぬ馬鹿、二度登る馬鹿

> “A wise man climbs Mt. Fuji once, only a fool climbs it twice.”

Re-visited a well known city in the 関西地方 (Kansai Region)[^1].

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(leaflet)

# Coordinates for Kyoto
kyoto_lat <- 35.0116
kyoto_lng <- 135.7681

# Create the map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = kyoto_lng, lat = kyoto_lat, zoom = 12) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = kyoto_lng, lat = kyoto_lat, popup = "Kyoto, Japan")
```

Many thousands of others had the same idea.[^2]

[^2]: Coincidentally, this week is the golden week for visitors from China

Met a couple from Italy (husband) and Swiss (wife). They were on their way to Kagoshima, located at the southern most part of Kyushu, the furtherest one could travel on the Shinkansen.

About 7 hours in a train Versus 1 hour 45 minute flight.

Met another person who was visiting with his parent. They were visiting onsens around Atami and other places

Interestingly, wife did the heavy lifting. Hope he has some back issues.

As we were passing the plains of Shizuoka, everyone in the train was pointing their cameras and cell phones towards 富士山. It was a cloudy/rainy day.

富士山 is difficult to see, even on a clear day. It has its own climate, cloud pattern.

I got lucky

## Arashiyama Bamboo Forest

Wasn't too worried about finding the bamboo forest. Just follow the crowd.

However, my travelling companion was. Luckily we ran into a fellow traveler from Washington. She treats herself to an overseas travel on her birthday.

As expected many people lined up to visit the forest.

#| echo: false

# Coordinates for Kyoto
bamboo_lat <- 35.009392
bamboo_lng <- 135.667007

# Create the map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = bamboo_lng, lat = bamboo_lat, zoom = 12) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = bamboo_lng, lat = bamboo_lat, popup = "嵐山竹林")

```

Saga Bamboo Grove

How to get there, from Kyoto Station, take the San in Line and get off at the Saga Arashiyama Station

## Lesson Learned

Decided to see where the Toris end.

From posts on social media and internet coverage, had the misconception that Toris were for a short duration.

I was way off.

The trail kept climbing and toris kept up.

No end in sight.

I asked a number of people that were on their way down.

They all gave different estimate on the time it takes to get to the top.

I had to have my internal compass and timer and not rely on others.

Glad we took time to relax and take some photos at various mid-points.

For there were no vista at the top and it was getting dark by the time we reached the top.

On the way down, encouraged youngsters that were following their parents.

The way down was much faster.
