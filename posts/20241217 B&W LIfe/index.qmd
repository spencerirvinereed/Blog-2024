When I lived in Korea, nearly all of life's snapshot were black and white photos.

During a recent dinner, with a Korean couple, we were trying to state who had a tougher life as a child in Korea.

When I said, we were poor and we only had running indoor plumbing but no indoor toilet.

The guest mentioned, that would have been considered a luxury item, in the village where he grew up.

Low resolution, Lo-Fi

> couldn’t remember any names now, able to recognise a few faces

But if that low resolution, barely distinguishable Black & White photo triggers a memory, it has done its job.

Even if photos were taken in color, would there be any vibrant colors?
Life was bit dreary and B&W was the correct medium.

Life got better and we got a land line phone.
A Black rotary phone with 5 digits, 1 for the station and a 4-digit number.
We also got a black piano finish entertainment set.
It played vinyls or records.
Then we got the first B&W TV Set in the neighborhood.
Only a few stations, including the AFKN network.

Then homeland economy took off

Analog things are finite.
And for this life, it might be enough.
