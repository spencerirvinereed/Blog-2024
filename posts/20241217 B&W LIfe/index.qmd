When I lived in Korea, nearly all of life's snapshots were black and white photos.

I also remember getting a land-line phone. A black rotary phone with 5 digits, 1 for the station and a 4-digit private number.

We also got a black piano finish entertainment set. It played vinyls or records.

Then we got the first B&W TV Set in the neighborhood. Only a few stations, including the AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) Network.

Even if photos were taken in color, would there be any vibrant colors? 

My recollection of those years is, life was void of colors, it was always cold, since we walked to most places.

Life was bit dreary and B&W was the correct medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a recent dinner, with a Korean couple, we were trying to state who had a tougher life as a child in Korea.

A game of **who walked further to school in snow**.

When I said, we were poor and we only had running indoor plumbing but no indoor toilet.

The guest mentioned, indoor plumbing would have been considered a luxury item, in the village where he grew up.

## Low resolution (Lo-Fi), high recollection

> "...couldn’t remember any names now, able to recognize a few faces"

This was a comment by a colleague from Singapore, when asked about other colleagues.

But if that low resolution, barely distinguishable Black & White photo triggers a memory, it has done its job.

One additional aspect of analog, B&W world was its finite nature.

We didn't know about money,

In the mid-1960s, GDP per capita was around $100–150 (USD)

Food was in short supply,

We were lucky to eat some meat, almost always pork, during holidays and special occasions.

In the limited material world, we had to use our imagination to play and look forward to the future.

I now face, nearly endless offerings and choices.

Digital enhancement, digital creation.

> Does analog product with its low resolution have a chance?

Even though it has errors and imperfections, there is something soothing about analog sounds and visions.

Lack of estimation or quantization but a represention of continuous data.

It is no longer a choice between digital or analog.
Both can coexist and serve a different purpose and audience.
