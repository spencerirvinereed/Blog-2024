Once, nearly all of life's snapshots were black and white photos.

Also remember getting a land-line phone.

A black rotary phone with 5 digits, 1 for the station and a 4-digit private number.

A black, piano-finish entertainment set graced our home. It played vinyls or records and we could tune in radio stations.

Then we got a B&W TV Set. Only a few stations, including the AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) Network.

> Even if photos were taken in color, would there be any vibrant colors?

My recollection of those years is, life was void of colors, and it was always cold, since we walked to most places.

Life was bit dreary and B&W was the correct medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a recent dinner, with a Korean couple, we were trying to state who had a tougher life as a child in Korea.

A game of **who walked further to school in snow**.

When I said, we were poor and we only had running indoor plumbing but no indoor toilet.

The guest mentioned, indoor plumbing would have been a luxury item, in the village where he grew up.

## Low resolution (Lo-Fi), high recollection

> "...couldn’t remember any names now, able to recognize a few faces"

This was a comment by a colleague from Singapore, when asked about other colleagues during the turn of the century years.

But if that low resolution, barely distinguishable Black & White photo triggers a memory, it has done its job.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder what kind of colors would be represented in the next life.

John records,

*5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.*

*6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:*

*7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.*

Perhaps more refined, more powerful light than our senses can conceive or bear.

That light will reveal colors and other spectrum we have not been aware of.

Where perception and processing are done at levels we cannot comprehend as mortals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One other aspect of analog, or B&W world was its finite nature.

In the limited material world, we had to use our imagination to play and look forward to the future.

Now days, the spectrum of information is expanding and overflowing. Some experts are alarmed at the pace and breadth of progress, especially AI.

Words from Matthew is comforting,

> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.

For now, I am content to learn as much as possible using analog and its derivative, digitized knowledge.

Judiciously accessing on-line and balancing it against, lessons and memories of growing up years.

Relying on the traditions that were taught through my parents and the family

Until a more perfect or excellent way is introduced and adopted.

Here are some common concerns about the advancement of technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1. Ethical Concerns**

-   **Bias and Discrimination:**\
    AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate or amplify existing biases in data, leading to unfair outcomes in areas like hiring, lending, and law enforcement.

-   **Privacy Invasion:**\
    The use of AI in surveillance and data analysis raises concerns about individual privacy and the potential for misuse of personal data.

-   **Loss of Autonomy:**\
    As AI makes decisions in critical areas (e.g., healthcare, justice systems), there is concern over humans losing control or being overruled by algorithms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **2. Economic and Social Disruption**

-   **Job Displacement:**\
    Automation and AI could replace jobs in various sectors, leading to unemployment and economic inequality.

-   **Digital Divide:**\
    Those without access to advanced technology or skills to work with AI may be left behind, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities.

-   **Dependence on AI:**\
    Over-reliance on AI systems might reduce critical thinking and problem-solving skills among individuals and organizations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **3. Security Risks**

-   **Cybersecurity Threats:**\
    AI tools could be used to create sophisticated cyberattacks, such as deepfakes, phishing scams, or hacking systems.

-   **Weaponization of AI:**\
    The development of autonomous weapons and AI in military applications raises fears of misuse and unintended consequences.

-   **Data Breaches:**\
    AI systems often rely on vast amounts of sensitive data, which, if breached, could cause widespread harm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **4. Misinformation and Manipulation**

-   **Deepfakes:**\
    AI-generated videos or audio can be used to create realistic but false content, undermining trust in media and individuals.

-   **Algorithmic Manipulation:**\
    AI-driven platforms might amplify misinformation or manipulate opinions by targeting users with tailored content.

-   **Erosion of Trust:**\
    The inability to discern real from artificial content could lead to a general distrust of digital information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **5. Existential Risks**

-   **Superintelligence Concerns:**\
    The idea of AI surpassing human intelligence raises fears about whether such systems could act against human interests.

-   **Loss of Control:**\
    Advanced AI systems might evolve or behave in unforeseen ways, making it challenging to regulate or contain their actions.

-   **Ethical Dilemmas:**\
    Developing AI capable of making moral or ethical decisions may lead to complex philosophical and practical challenges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **6. Regulation and Accountability**

-   **Lack of Oversight:**\
    Rapid AI advancements often outpace the creation of laws or guidelines, leaving a regulatory void.

-   **Accountability Gaps:**\
    Determining responsibility when AI systems fail or cause harm can be challenging, especially in multi-party collaborations.

-   **Global Imbalances:**\
    Unequal regulation across nations might lead to "AI arms races" or exploitation of less regulated regions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **7. Impact on Human Identity**

-   **Loss of Creativity:**\
    Concerns about AI-generated art, music, and literature overshadowing human creativity and expression.

-   **Human Connection:**\
    Increased reliance on AI for interaction (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants) might reduce meaningful human relationships.

-   **Philosophical Questions:**\
    The potential for AI to mimic consciousness or emotions raises questions about what it means to be human.
