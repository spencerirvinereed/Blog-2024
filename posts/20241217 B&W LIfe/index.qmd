When I lived in Korea, nearly all of life's snapshots were black and white photos.

I also remember getting a land-line phone. A black rotary phone with 5 digits, 1 for the station and a 4-digit private number.

We also got a black piano finish entertainment set. It played vinyls or records and radio stations.

Then we got a B&W TV Set. Only a few stations, including the AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) Network.

> Even if photos were taken in color, would there be any vibrant colors?

My recollection of those years is, life was void of colors, and it was always cold, since we walked to most places.

Life was bit dreary and B&W was the correct medium.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a recent dinner, with a Korean couple, we were trying to state who had a tougher life as a child in Korea.

A game of **who walked further to school in snow**.

When I said, we were poor and we only had running indoor plumbing but no indoor toilet.

The guest mentioned, indoor plumbing would have been a luxury item, in the village where he grew up.

## Low resolution (Lo-Fi), high recollection

> "...couldn’t remember any names now, able to recognize a few faces"

This was a comment by a colleague from Singapore, when asked about other colleagues.

But if that low resolution, barely distinguishable Black & White photo triggers a memory, it has done its job.

I wonder what kind of colors would be represented in the next life.

John records,

5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.

Perhaps more refined, more powerful light than our senses can conceive or bear.

That light will reveal colors and other spectrum we have not been aware of.

Where perception and processing are done at levels we cannot comprehend as mortals.

One other aspect of analog, or B&W world was its finite nature.

In the limited material world, we had to use our imagination to play and look forward to the future.

For now, I am content to learn as much as possible using analog and its derivative, digitized knowledge.

Until a more perfect or excellent way is introduced and adopted.
