Sat in the front of the chapel to support a departing couple. They are to serve in Thailand for 2 years.

In the front row were an older woman and a young person. The young person called the other "Mommy" even though she could have been her grandmother.

The speakers were departing on their 4th mission in 10 years, in addition they also served in the MTC branch. The sister spoke of leaving their grandchildren behind. The brother relived growing years and how the Sabbath worship service had evolved.

Afterwards, we asked the older person, the relationship. The young person was the daughter of her son's ex-wife.

The ex-wife had married again and had the daughter then passed away. The mother in-law found the young person in the foster home and had adopted her.

It is not often, that an ex-daughter-in-law's child from another marriage is adopted.

A sister had been away for a number of weeks.

Commented that her son and daughter-in-law could have conducted and accompanied a General Conference. She was beaming and she looked, for a moment, much younger

Asked her where her twins served. Troy, who was playing the organ, served in Japan. Trent, in Singapore, served in Korea

Started a chat with a BYU professor about the article in the Daily Universe He hadn't seen it.

Asked his neighbor about what will happen to the house. The couples children will take turns watching it, keep it in the family.

He also mentioned that the new house being built will have an indoor swimming pool. The occupants are headed by a doctor.

Yesterday, at Lowe's ran into old neighbors. He is currently serving as the Young Men General President

It was good to be recognized by old friends and talk of good old days. Also getting caught up on where the families of next generation are.
