Asked my chief adviser,

> Is it better to try something and not achieve it?

OR

> Not try it in the first place, knowing the difficulty and the low probability of success.

Emphatic **NO** was the reply.

> Of course it is better to try, even if you don't succeed

She is correct.

In the years past, I would have agreed.

However, as I age, the thought of distress on top of efforts is losing its appeal.

I can remember the cycle of disappointments and hope after applying for positions.

Taking a difficult test and wondering if I had a future in the chosen field.

All these were easier when younger.

There were time to make up for losses and disappointments.

Each passing year seem to enhance challenges and reduce the ability to face them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then I remembered a song from a while back.

Back in the 80s, sung by a Canadian Trio.

Their song began,

> Days grow shorter and the nights are getting long
>
> Feels like we're running out of time
>
> Every day it seems much harder tellin' right from wrong
>
> You got to read between the lines

it continues...

> Don't get discouraged, don't be afraid
>
> We can make it through another day

Back when I was listening to this song on the radio, I couldn't understand the lyrics beyond the first verse.

But I understood the overall message of the song and the upbeat music lifted my spirit.

Thank you group Triumph.

The last verse says,




![](images/20241110_085857-EDIT.jpg)

> All your life you've been waiting for your chance
>
> Where you'll fit into the plan
>
> But you're the master of your own destiny
>
> So give and take the best that you can

There were times when I wondered when the plan would manifest itself, and how I would fit into it.

Filling of not fitting in is something I am familiar with, a fringe figure.

At times lonely but knowing there a was plan helped me.

Eventually, I was able to arrive at a place where I could realize my small wishes and establish a footing in the society — with help from the family and from Above.

Those that were present at critical times and places. Thank you.

So I will continue to,

> Fight the good fight of the faith.
>
> Take hold of the eternal life
>
> to which you were called
>
> when you made your good confession
>
> in the presence of many witnesses.
