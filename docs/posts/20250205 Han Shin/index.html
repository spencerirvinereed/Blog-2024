<p>We, as a family, got a glimpse into Chinese History via Mitstuteru Yokoyama (横山 光輝).</p>
<p>There were 2 Manga series, translated into Korean.</p>
<p>史記 and 項羽, 劉邦</p>
<p>Learned about military campaigns and strategies. Taking places in places of legendary importance.</p>
<p>Although history by necessity highlights key figures, There are many that are not mentioned but we know they were part of it. Reminding us how much people of China have endured.</p>
<p>Then there is one Han Shin,</p>
<p>What if he stayed as a humble, normal human</p>
<p>He had a recommendation letter, but kept it hidden. Letting the persons in charge make a decision on their own.</p>
<p>How did he become so knowledgable and wise.</p>
<p>How did his poverty in growing up affect his outlook and deep insights. Perhaps, as historian, Victor Davis Hanson says, &gt; Those that work with hand and the earth, inherently understand better how things</p>
<p>What drove Han Shin to his greatness.</p>
<hr>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biography-of-han-xin-韩信-196-bce"><strong>Biography of Han Xin (韩信, ? – 196 BCE)</strong></h3>
<section id="early-life-and-rise-to-power" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-life-and-rise-to-power"><strong>Early Life and Rise to Power</strong></h4>
<p>Han Xin was born in <strong>Huaiyin, Jiangsu</strong> during the late Qin Dynasty. Although from a humble background, he studied military strategy extensively and aspired to become a great general. Initially, he struggled to gain recognition, even facing humiliation, such as the famous incident where he crawled between a butcher’s legs after being insulted.</p>
<p>Han Xin first sought employment under <strong>Xiang Yu</strong>, the powerful warlord leading the anti-Qin rebellion. However, he was not given a key position and later defected to <strong>Liu Bang</strong>, the future founder of the Han Dynasty. Liu Bang’s strategist <strong>Xiao He</strong> recognized Han Xin’s potential, even chasing after him when he once attempted to leave. Liu Bang eventually appointed him as <strong>Grand Marshal (大将军)</strong> of the Han forces.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-military-achievements" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-military-achievements"><strong>Key Military Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Han Xin played a <strong>decisive role in the Chu-Han Contention (206–202 BCE)</strong>, the struggle between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu for control over China after the fall of the Qin Dynasty. His key campaigns included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Crossing of the Wei River (Wei River Strategy, 204 BCE)</strong> – A bold maneuver where he tricked an enemy force into surrendering by securing a strategic river crossing.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Conquest of Northern China (204–203 BCE)</strong> – He defeated regional warlords in Zhao, Yan, and Qi, ensuring Han control over large territories.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Battle of Gaixia (202 BCE)</strong> – His <strong>“Ten-Sided Ambush” (十面埋伏)</strong> strategy helped decisively defeat Xiang Yu, leading to the unification of China under Liu Bang.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="downfall-and-death" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="downfall-and-death"><strong>Downfall and Death</strong></h4>
<p>Despite his battlefield successes, Han Xin’s political position became precarious after Liu Bang established the <strong>Han Dynasty (202 BCE)</strong>. As a powerful general with widespread influence, he was seen as a threat by Liu Bang and Empress Lü.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demotion</strong> – Initially granted the title of <strong>King of Chu</strong>, he was later demoted to <strong>Marquis of Huaiyin</strong> after accusations of disloyalty.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Execution (196 BCE)</strong> – Under the orders of Empress Lü, Han Xin was lured into a trap and executed on charges of treason.</li>
</ul>

<section id="legacy" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legacy"><strong>Legacy</strong></h4>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anecdotes-from-the-life-of-han-xin"><strong>Anecdotes from the Life of Han Xin</strong></h3>
<p>Han Xin’s life was filled with dramatic events that shaped his character and legacy. Here are some of the most famous stories about his early struggles, humility, and rise to power.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-humiliation-by-the-butcher-胯下之辱" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-humiliation-by-the-butcher-胯下之辱"><strong>1. The Humiliation by the Butcher (胯下之辱)</strong></h3>
<p>When Han Xin was young, he was poor and often seen carrying a sword but without any real power. One day, a local butcher mocked him in public, saying:</p>
<p><em>“If you’re really brave, kill me with your sword! If you’re a coward, crawl between my legs!”</em></p>
<p>Han Xin, rather than reacting violently, <strong>chose to endure humiliation</strong> and crawled between the butcher’s legs. The onlookers laughed at him, but this moment demonstrated his patience and ability to endure hardship—qualities that later helped him in military and political life.</p>
<p>📌 <strong>Lesson</strong>: This story became a symbol of strategic patience. Han Xin knew that responding with violence would lead to unnecessary trouble, and instead, he focused on his long-term goal of success.</p>

<section id="the-kind-woman-who-fed-him-漂母之恩" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-kind-woman-who-fed-him-漂母之恩"><strong>2. The Kind Woman Who Fed Him (漂母之恩)</strong></h3>
<p>As a young man, Han Xin struggled to make a living and often went hungry. One day, an <strong>old woman who washed clothes by the river</strong> saw his condition and offered him food. She did this multiple times without expecting anything in return.</p>
<p>Han Xin was deeply moved and told her:</p>
<p><em>“One day, when I succeed, I will repay your kindness.”</em></p>
<p>Years later, after becoming a powerful general, Han Xin searched for the woman and <strong>rewarded her with 1,000 taels of gold</strong>, fulfilling his promise.</p>
<p>📌 <strong>Lesson</strong>: This story highlights Han Xin’s gratitude and integrity. It also teaches that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can have a lasting impact.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="xiao-hes-pursuit-萧何月下追韩信"><strong>3. Xiao He’s Pursuit (萧何月下追韩信)</strong></h3>
<p>Despite his talent, Han Xin was initially overlooked by Liu Bang. Frustrated, he left the Han camp. However, Liu Bang’s top advisor, <strong>Xiao He</strong>, recognized Han Xin’s genius and personally chased after him on horseback under the moonlight.</p>
<p>When Liu Bang saw Xiao He returning with Han Xin, he asked why he had gone after him so urgently. Xiao He replied:</p>
<p><em>“Losing a horse or gold is no big deal, but losing Han Xin means losing the empire!”</em></p>
<p>Impressed, Liu Bang <strong>appointed Han Xin as Grand Marshal</strong>, giving him full control of the Han army.</p>
<p>📌 <strong>Lesson</strong>: This story demonstrates the importance of <strong>recognizing and valuing talent</strong>. Xiao He’s keen eye for ability ensured Han Xin’s rise, ultimately leading to Liu Bang’s victory in the Chu-Han Contention.</p>

<hr>
<p>During the Chu-Han War, Han Xin was not given much importance in Xiang Yu’s account. It happened that Zhang Liang, a Han strategist, went out to look for talented generals. Zhang Liang visited Han Xin and gave him a letter of recommendation, asking him to meet Liu Bang. When Han Xin arrived in Baozhong, Xiahou Ying introduced him to the Prime Minister Xiao He, who valued him. Xiao He recommended Han Xin to Liu Bang, but Liu Bang refused to use him after learning that Han Xin was of humble origin. Xiao He repeatedly reported to Liu Bang and strongly recommended Han Xin as a general. Liu Bang refused and insisted on waiting for the talents recommended by Zhang Liang to arrive. Seeing that the Prime Minister recommended him again and again, but the King of Han still refused to listen, Han Xin left a poem and left his post at night. When Xiao He heard that Han Xin had left, he was afraid of losing the talent, so he chased him under the moonlight despite the difficulty of the road. When he saw Han Xin, Xiao He fell off his horse in a hurry and tiredness, but still urged Han Xin to return to Baozhong. Han Xin was deeply moved, so he took out Zhang Liang’s letter of recommendation. Xiao He was overjoyed and went to see Liu Bang with Han Xin. After seeing Zhang Liang’s recommendation, Liu Bang immediately appointed Han Xin as the general. At Xiao He’s suggestion, he built a high altar for Han Xin and went up to the altar to worship him. From then on, Liu Bang relied on Xiao He for civil affairs and Han Xin for military affairs, and led his army eastward to fight for the world. [3</p>
