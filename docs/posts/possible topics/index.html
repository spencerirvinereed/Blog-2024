<p>#####</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I live close to a location with both a nondescript and a pedestrian name.</p>
<p>That aptly named place was accessible for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>During those years, it was like a National Park hours away, for I visited it once a year or less.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I rediscovered it recently.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>For most of those years, I was commuting to Salt Lake Valley - over a 30-mile commute.</p>
<p>A change in job to a Utah Valley location meant the commuting time spent in cars or trains/buses can be replaced by a number of activities.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I followed a suggestion on a website.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The canyon…draws thou­sands of peo­ple annu­ally who seek recre­ation, renewal, and inspi­ra­tion. It is one of the few remaining “URBAN FORESTS” in the United States</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Few times that I hiked the area, I was not impressed.</p>
<p>Aside from a few geological features, the trail was unremarkable.</p>
<p>I usually went after the sun had risen, during the summer months.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Afterwards, I concluded that an hour or two spent in the canyon or the forest was not worth it.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Then I switched the hiking hours so that I could visit the area in the morning and still be at work</p>
<p>That meant an adjustment to the sleeping schedule.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The early morning hours highlighted peaks, fauna, and flora that I hadn’t noticed before.</p>
<p>As I began to notice the small changes in the surroundings, I began to track not only sunrise and sunset information but also moonrise and moonset data.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>It was almost like being transported to a different location in a time capsule – and back invigorated.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Those trips offered visual and aural as well as tactile experiences</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The time spent in that capsule filters and clears my thoughts.</p>
<p>It allows me to forget things I should not hold onto.</p>
<p>Lightens my mind and my burden.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I have experienced some of the more established, crowd-inviting locations with more exotic offerings.</p>
<p>But it was nearly impossible to experience the offerings during the peak visiting hours with all the other guests.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I have to agree with Mark Twain.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize I lived next door to a National Park called Rock Canyon.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>“When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much he had learned in seven years.”–Mark Twain</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>chose to hike</p>
<p>It seemed like an aptly named area with a prominent peak visible from the valley.</p>
<p>Didn’t pay much attention to the canyon hike.</p>
<p><br>

<br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p>
<p>It seemed like an aptly named area with a prominent peak visible from the valley.</p>
<p>Didn’t pay much attention to the canyon hike.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>There was no water running a few times when I hiked it.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The place transforms itself.</p>
<p>Not only seasons of the year but also during time of the day.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Rock Canyon, adjacent to Provo, Utah, draws thou­sands of peo­ple annu­ally who seek <strong>recre­ation, renewal, and inspi­ra­tion.</strong> It is one of the few remaining <strong>“URBAN FORESTS”</strong> in the United States</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>https://www.rockcanyonutah.com/</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Tracked not only sunrise and sunset but also moonrise and moonset.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>For all those who hike up there are those that are those that are on their way down.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>For those that hike, there are those that run.</p>
<p>For everyone that runs, are there ones that fly?</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>There are certainly more well established and advertised, with more exotic destinations.</p>
<p>For me, Rock Canyon is that and more since it is accessible, renews itself, and inspirational.</p>

<p>.Lao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and the founder of Taoism. His teachings revolve around the concept of Tao, which can be translated as “The Way” or “The Way of Nature.” Here are some key ideas from Lao Tzu’s teachings:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>1. Tao: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the Tao, the natural and universal principle that underlies everything in existence. The Tao is seen as an impersonal force that cannot be fully understood or described but can be experienced.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>2. Wu-wei: Lao Tzu advocated for the principle of Wu-wei, which can be translated as “non-action” or “effortless action.” It involves aligning oneself with the natural flow of the Tao and acting without unnecessary force or resistance. It is about allowing things to unfold naturally rather than trying to control or manipulate them.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>3. Simplicity and Spontaneity: Lao Tzu emphasized the value of simplicity and spontaneity in life. He believed that by letting go of desires, attachments, and excessive ambition, one can achieve inner peace and harmony. By embracing simplicity and being in tune with the natural rhythms of life, one can live a more fulfilling existence.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>4. Humility and Detachment: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of humility and detachment. He encouraged individuals to let go of ego and the need for recognition, and instead cultivate a sense of modesty and detachment from material possessions and social status. By doing so, one can attain true wisdom and freedom.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>5. Paradoxical Thinking: Lao Tzu often employed paradoxical statements to challenge conventional wisdom and encourage deeper reflection. He believed that reality is multifaceted and cannot be fully grasped through dualistic thinking. By embracing paradoxes and transcending binary concepts, individuals can gain a more profound understanding of the nature of existence.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Overall, Lao Tzu’s teachings revolve around living in harmony with the natural order, embracing simplicity, acting without force, and cultivating humility and detachment. His philosophy encourages individuals to let go of unnecessary desires and attachments in order to achieve inner peace and align themselves with the profound wisdom of the Tao.</p>

<p>Buddhism is a spiritual tradition that originated in ancient India and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. The teachings of Buddhism, often referred to as the Dharma, offer guidance on how to live a meaningful and enlightened life. Here are some key teachings of Buddhism:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>1. The Four Noble Truths: These are considered the foundational teachings of Buddhism. They are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Dukkha (Suffering): Life is characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Samudaya (Origin of Suffering): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering): It is possible to end suffering by letting go of attachments and desires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;Magga (Path to the Cessation of Suffering): The Noble Eightfold Path leads to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>2. The Noble Eightfold Path: This path provides practical guidelines for living a moral, balanced, and mindful life. It consists of eight interconnected aspects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Right View: Understanding the true nature of reality and the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Right Intention: Cultivating positive intentions and letting go of harmful thoughts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;Right Speech: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and avoiding harmful speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;Right Action: Acting in ways that are ethical, compassionate, and non-harming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Right Livelihood: Engaging in a profession that promotes well-being and avoids harm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;Right Effort: Cultivating wholesome qualities and letting go of unwholesome ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. Right Mindfulness: Developing present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. Right Concentration: Cultivating focused and tranquil states of mind through meditation.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>3. Impermanence: Buddhism emphasizes the understanding that everything in life is impermanent. All conditioned phenomena, including ourselves, are subject to change and decay. Recognizing this truth helps us let go of attachments and reduces suffering.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>4. No-Self (Anatta): Buddhism teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. Instead, our existence is characterized by a constantly changing flow of physical and mental processes. Understanding the absence of a fixed self leads to a more liberated and interconnected view of reality.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>5. Compassion and Loving-kindness: Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings. This includes developing empathy, extending goodwill, and working towards alleviating the suffering of others.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>6. Mindfulness and Meditation: Buddhism places great emphasis on the practice of mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of one’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Meditation cultivates concentration, insight, and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>7. Karma and Rebirth: Buddhism teaches the concept of karma, which states that our intentional actions have consequences. Positive actions lead to positive outcomes, while negative actions lead to suffering. Buddhism also holds the belief in rebirth, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth until one achieves enlightenment and liberation from this cycle.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>These teachings of Buddhism provide a comprehensive framework for individuals to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and inner peace while navigating the challenges of existence. Buddhism encourages personal inquiry, self-reflection, and the development of ethical behavior and mental well-being.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Christianity is a major world religion that is centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Its teachings are based on the Bible, particularly the New Testament, and vary across different denominations. Here are some key teachings of Christianity:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>1. The Nature of God: Christianity teaches the belief in one God who is eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good. God is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe and is revealed as Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit (the Trinitarian nature of God).</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>2. Jesus Christ as Savior: Christianity holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Messiah who came to save humanity from sin and offer eternal life. Jesus’ life, teachings, death on the cross, and resurrection are central to Christian faith and provide redemption and reconciliation with God.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>3. Salvation through Faith: Christianity teaches that salvation is a gift from God, not something earned by human efforts. It is received through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, acknowledging His sacrificial death and accepting His forgiveness. Christians believe in the importance of repentance, turning away from sin, and receiving God’s grace.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>4. Love, Compassion, and Morality: Christianity emphasizes the commandment to love God and love one’s neighbor as oneself. Christians are encouraged to show compassion, kindness, forgiveness, and generosity to others. Christian moral teachings encompass a wide range of principles, including honesty, integrity, respect for life, sexual purity, and social justice.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>5. The Bible as Sacred Scripture: The Bible is considered the inspired Word of God in Christianity. It consists of the Old Testament, which contains the religious texts of Judaism, and the New Testament, which focuses on the life and teachings of Jesus and the early Christian community. The Bible serves as a guide for faith, doctrine, ethics, and spiritual growth.</p>

<p><br>
</p>
<p>1. Dualistic Cosmology: Manichaeism presents a dualistic worldview in which the universe is seen as a battleground between the forces of light and darkness.

<p><br>
</p>

<p><br>
</p>
<p>7. Rituals and Worship: Manichaeism had various rituals and practices, including baptism, prayer, and the recitation of sacred texts. Rituals were often performed in designated sacred spaces.</p>
