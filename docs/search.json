    "section": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples",
    "text": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples\nThe story of ark as a representation of a temple. Reed Walls is like the veil. Ark came to rest on the top of the mountain. Dimensions of arks are representing the temple.\nHighest levels of temples (ark) as the presence of God.\nMoses tried to usher the people into the presence of God\n24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.\nD&C 84\n\nRepresentations of temples are everywhere around us. But hidden from the world. For they are spirtually discerned In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim plays a critical role as a character who possesses the secret to immortality. His encounter with the hero, Gilgamesh, marks a pivotal moment in the story, as Gilgamesh’s quest for eternal life reaches its climax. Here’s a breakdown of Utnapishtim’s role in the epic:\n\n1. The Survivor of the Great Flood\n\nUtnapishtim is most famous for surviving a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity. His story bears significant resemblance to the biblical account of Noah’s Ark in the Book of Genesis.\nHe was warned by the god Ea (Enki) about the impending flood and instructed to build a massive boat to save himself, his family, and the animals.\nAfter the flood, Utnapishtim and his wife were granted immortality by the gods as a reward for preserving life and obeying their command.\n\n\n\n2. Symbol of Immortality\n\nGilgamesh seeks out Utnapishtim after the death of his friend Enkidu, driven by a fear of death and a desire to discover the secret of eternal life.\nUtnapishtim represents the possibility of immortality, something that Gilgamesh believes he can attain.\nHowever, Utnapishtim’s story ultimately shows that immortality is not meant for mortals. While he and his wife were granted eternal life, this was an exception and not something Gilgamesh can achieve through effort or desire.\n\n\n\n3. The Test of Endurance\n\nWhen Gilgamesh meets Utnapishtim, he pleads for the secret to eternal life. Instead of directly giving it to him, Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s endurance by challenging him to stay awake for six days and seven nights.\nGilgamesh fails the test, falling asleep almost immediately, which underscores the frailty and limitations of human beings. Utnapishtim demonstrates that if Gilgamesh cannot conquer something as simple as sleep, he is unworthy of immortality.\n\n\n\n4. The Plant of Youth\n\nDespite Gilgamesh’s failure, Utnapishtim shows some compassion and reveals the existence of a plant at the bottom of the ocean that can restore youth.\nGilgamesh successfully retrieves the plant, but on his way back to his city, a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh loses the chance for renewed youth. This event highlights the theme of inevitable mortality and the elusiveness of eternal life.\n\n\n\n5. Philosophical Message\n\nUtnapishtim’s role is crucial in conveying one of the central themes of the Epic of Gilgamesh: the inevitability of death and the importance of living a full and meaningful life.\nHe helps Gilgamesh realize that instead of seeking immortality, he should focus on the legacy he leaves behind and the life he leads on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Utnapishtim’s Role:\n\nSurvivor of the Flood: He provides the key mythological story about a great flood and the gods’ decision to grant him immortality.\nTest of Gilgamesh: Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s ability to transcend mortal limitations, which Gilgamesh fails.\nLesson in Mortality: He teaches Gilgamesh that immortality is reserved for the gods and special circumstances, and that human beings must come to terms with death.\nConveys the Epic’s Theme: Utnapishtim helps shift Gilgamesh’s quest from a search for eternal life to a recognition of the need to live meaningfully."

Thank you.\nLast weekend, my husband and I had the opportunity to attend a stake conference in Tokyo we also had the opportunity to visit three sisters and their families.\ncoincidentally, all three sisters were terminally ill. But, while visiting, I saw that the sisters understood Heavenly Father’s perfect plan of salvation and endured this hardship with faith in power, so I was so touched to see them so joyfully.\none of the sisters had cancer cells that had spread throughout her body, and the doctor said that there was nothing more she could do, so she had only about two months to live.\nSo we visited her. So now, I think she was so tired that she couldn’t even come to see us. I was worried about what to do if it was hard, so I went in the door, but that sister was smiling so brightly and saying that it was dinner time in the kitchen, so she was diligently and happily preparing food for us.\nAs I looked at the sister, she said that of course she was physically and mentally tired, but she was thinking about how she could serve and help others in this situation.\nShe said that her husband was in charge of the missionary work, and that her husband helped her diligently, and that two baptisms had come out recently.\nShe said that she was so happy because she was living in joy, and she felt that her body was becoming more energetic and better. When I saw that sister, who was really struggling, did not get frustrated by her own difficulties, but instead reached out to others,\nI thought that she was a person who really resembled the Lord. At the general conference last October, I would like to share a word that Elder Quentin Cook said.\nIt was one of my favorite tables. It was about following Christ in peace. He spoke about where it is possible to be, and he said this: We do not know all the answers to what happens in life, but we do know important principles that will help us face realization, hardship, and adversity with faith and confidence in the bright future that awaits each of us.\nI testify that those who follow Christ in peace will find personal peace both in this life and in our glorious reunion in heaven. I was strengthened by the words of the State of the Union.\nI testify that even in this climate, when we look to Jesus Christ and focus on the peace and healing He offers, all the difficulties and hardships we face can be transformed into joy and hope. I testify that our Heavenly Father knows and loves us all, and that Jesus is my Redeemer and Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n먼저 이렇게 여러분들에게 제 간증을 전할 수 있는 길를 주시는 Cook 장로님께 감사를 드립니다\n아 얼마 전에 한한 2주 전에 그 저희 자녀 중에 한 명이 저에게 어\n아버지 아버지는 이제이 새로운 부름을 받고 봉사하시는 지난 몇 개월간\n무엇을 배 배웠습니까고 저한테 물어보더라고요 그 제가 곰곰히 생각을\n볼 수 있는 기회가 있었습니다 과연 지난 몇 달간 제가이 새로운 부름에서 봉사하면서 과연 나는 을 배웠는가\n그때 생각났던 바로 구절이 바로 그 니파의 후서 여러분 잘 아시는 4장\n3절의 말씀입니다 제가 이제 살아계신 선지자 선견자 계시자 이제 제 회당\n당과 그리고 또 오늘 저희들과 함께하고 계시는 우리 쿡 장로님이 비롯해서 어 12사도 정원의 어 우리\n사도님 그리고 시민 정원의 회장님 회장당선 있는 총관리 군들의 모습들을\n바라보면서 그분들이 매일매일 그리고 그 시간시간 그 때 그때마다 그분들이 얼마나이\n34절에 바로 그 고대의 몰의 예언자였던 선지자였던 니파이가\n저들에게 주해 주신 그분의 마음을 제가 배울 수가 있었습니다 34절에\n그분은 저희들에게 주여 내가 주를 의뢰 하였사오니 내가 또\n영원히 주를 의뢰하다 내가 육신의 팔에 나의\n신뢰를 두지 아니하리니 이는 육신의에 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자가 저주를 받는 줄 내가 니이다\n참으로 사람에게 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자 육신으로 자기의 팔을 삼는 자는\n저주를 받았나이다이 주님의 종들은 매시간\n시간 매 때마다 그분들은 인간의 팔에 의지하지 않고 고린 가지고 있는 그런\n개인 념이 생이나에 의지지 않고 항상\n주님께 의지하며 주님을 신뢰하며 그분께 그분의 도움을 구하는 모습들을 저는\n지켜보았습니다이 세상에 그 많은 것들이 저희들에게이 세상의 것에이\n사람의 팔에 의지하라고 저희들에게 가르치지만 저희들이 주님께 저의 마음을 돌리고 그분께 신라고 그분을\n신뢰하고 그분의 팔에 의지할 때 참으로 저희들이이 세상이 끝나고 후에도 영원히 오는이 세상에서 저들이\n그분의 축복을 받은 사실 간증 드리면서 여러분들의 수고와 여러분들 신앙 사심에 큰 감사를 드리면서\n여러분이 지치 하식 소망하겠습니다 예수님은 우리들의 그리스도이시며\n저희들의 구세 주님께 간증드립니다 예수 그리스도의 이름으로 간증드립니다 아멘\nFirst, I would like to thank the director for giving me the opportunity to share my testimony with you all.\nAh, a couple of weeks ago, one of our children asked me,\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nI had a chance to think carefully.\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nThe verse that came to mind was the verse in 2 Nephi 4:3 that you all know well. I now look at the living prophet, seer, revelator, my synagogue,\nand also at Elder Cook, who is with us today, and the general officers of the 12 Apostles, and the presidents of the civic garden,\nand how much they\nhave learned every day and every hour and every moment. Nephi\ngave me a glimpse of His heart. In verse 34,\nHe said to them, Lord, I have trusted in Thee, and I will\ntrust in Thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh, for I know that cursed is he who puts his trust in flesh.\nYea, cursed is he who puts his trust in man, who makes flesh his arm.\nThese servants of the Lord, hour by hour,\nThey do not rely on the arm of man, but they do not rely on the arm of life,\nbut they always rely on the Lord, they trust in Him, they ask for His help. I have\nwatched them. There are so many things in this world that teach us to rely on the arms of men,\nbut when we turn our hearts to the Lord, and trust in Him, and rely on His arm,\nwe will truly know that they have received His blessings in this world,\neven after this world is over, and in this world to come, for eternity. As I testify, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your hard work and your faith,\nand I hope that you will be tired. Jesus is our Christ,\nand I testify to our Savior, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."
