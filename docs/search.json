    "section": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples",
    "text": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples\nThe story of ark as a representation of a temple. Reed Walls is like the veil. Ark came to rest on the top of the mountain. Dimensions of arks are representing the temple.\nHighest levels of temples (ark) as the presence of God.\nMoses tried to usher the people into the presence of God\n24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.\nD&C 84\n\nRepresentations of temples are everywhere around us. But hidden from the world. For they are spirtually discerned In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim plays a critical role as a character who possesses the secret to immortality. His encounter with the hero, Gilgamesh, marks a pivotal moment in the story, as Gilgamesh’s quest for eternal life reaches its climax. Here’s a breakdown of Utnapishtim’s role in the epic:\n\n1. The Survivor of the Great Flood\n\nUtnapishtim is most famous for surviving a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity. His story bears significant resemblance to the biblical account of Noah’s Ark in the Book of Genesis.\nHe was warned by the god Ea (Enki) about the impending flood and instructed to build a massive boat to save himself, his family, and the animals.\nAfter the flood, Utnapishtim and his wife were granted immortality by the gods as a reward for preserving life and obeying their command.\n\n\n\n2. Symbol of Immortality\n\nGilgamesh seeks out Utnapishtim after the death of his friend Enkidu, driven by a fear of death and a desire to discover the secret of eternal life.\nUtnapishtim represents the possibility of immortality, something that Gilgamesh believes he can attain.\nHowever, Utnapishtim’s story ultimately shows that immortality is not meant for mortals. While he and his wife were granted eternal life, this was an exception and not something Gilgamesh can achieve through effort or desire.\n\n\n\n3. The Test of Endurance\n\nWhen Gilgamesh meets Utnapishtim, he pleads for the secret to eternal life. Instead of directly giving it to him, Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s endurance by challenging him to stay awake for six days and seven nights.\nGilgamesh fails the test, falling asleep almost immediately, which underscores the frailty and limitations of human beings. Utnapishtim demonstrates that if Gilgamesh cannot conquer something as simple as sleep, he is unworthy of immortality.\n\n\n\n4. The Plant of Youth\n\nDespite Gilgamesh’s failure, Utnapishtim shows some compassion and reveals the existence of a plant at the bottom of the ocean that can restore youth.\nGilgamesh successfully retrieves the plant, but on his way back to his city, a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh loses the chance for renewed youth. This event highlights the theme of inevitable mortality and the elusiveness of eternal life.\n\n\n\n5. Philosophical Message\n\nUtnapishtim’s role is crucial in conveying one of the central themes of the Epic of Gilgamesh: the inevitability of death and the importance of living a full and meaningful life.\nHe helps Gilgamesh realize that instead of seeking immortality, he should focus on the legacy he leaves behind and the life he leads on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Utnapishtim’s Role:\n\nSurvivor of the Flood: He provides the key mythological story about a great flood and the gods’ decision to grant him immortality.\nTest of Gilgamesh: Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s ability to transcend mortal limitations, which Gilgamesh fails.\nLesson in Mortality: He teaches Gilgamesh that immortality is reserved for the gods and special circumstances, and that human beings must come to terms with death.\nConveys the Epic’s Theme: Utnapishtim helps shift Gilgamesh’s quest from a search for eternal life to a recognition of the need to live meaningfully."

Thank you.\nLast weekend, my husband and I had the opportunity to attend a stake conference in Tokyo we also had the opportunity to visit three sisters and their families.\ncoincidentally, all three sisters were terminally ill. But, while visiting, I saw that the sisters understood Heavenly Father’s perfect plan of salvation and endured this hardship with faith in power, so I was so touched to see them so joyfully.\none of the sisters had cancer cells that had spread throughout her body, and the doctor said that there was nothing more she could do, so she had only about two months to live.\nSo we visited her. So now, I think she was so tired that she couldn’t even come to see us. I was worried about what to do if it was hard, so I went in the door, but that sister was smiling so brightly and saying that it was dinner time in the kitchen, so she was diligently and happily preparing food for us.\nAs I looked at the sister, she said that of course she was physically and mentally tired, but she was thinking about how she could serve and help others in this situation.\nShe said that her husband was in charge of the missionary work, and that her husband helped her diligently, and that two baptisms had come out recently.\nShe said that she was so happy because she was living in joy, and she felt that her body was becoming more energetic and better. When I saw that sister, who was really struggling, did not get frustrated by her own difficulties, but instead reached out to others,\nI thought that she was a person who really resembled the Lord. At the general conference last October, I would like to share a word that Elder Quentin Cook said.\nIt was one of my favorite tables. It was about following Christ in peace. He spoke about where it is possible to be, and he said this: We do not know all the answers to what happens in life, but we do know important principles that will help us face realization, hardship, and adversity with faith and confidence in the bright future that awaits each of us.\nI testify that those who follow Christ in peace will find personal peace both in this life and in our glorious reunion in heaven. I was strengthened by the words of the State of the Union.\nI testify that even in this climate, when we look to Jesus Christ and focus on the peace and healing He offers, all the difficulties and hardships we face can be transformed into joy and hope. I testify that our Heavenly Father knows and loves us all, and that Jesus is my Redeemer and Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n먼저 이렇게 여러분들에게 제 간증을 전할 수 있는 길를 주시는 Cook 장로님께 감사를 드립니다\n아 얼마 전에 한한 2주 전에 그 저희 자녀 중에 한 명이 저에게 어\n아버지 아버지는 이제이 새로운 부름을 받고 봉사하시는 지난 몇 개월간\n무엇을 배 배웠습니까고 저한테 물어보더라고요 그 제가 곰곰히 생각을\n볼 수 있는 기회가 있었습니다 과연 지난 몇 달간 제가이 새로운 부름에서 봉사하면서 과연 나는 을 배웠는가\n그때 생각났던 바로 구절이 바로 그 니파의 후서 여러분 잘 아시는 4장\n3절의 말씀입니다 제가 이제 살아계신 선지자 선견자 계시자 이제 제 회당\n당과 그리고 또 오늘 저희들과 함께하고 계시는 우리 쿡 장로님이 비롯해서 어 12사도 정원의 어 우리\n사도님 그리고 시민 정원의 회장님 회장당선 있는 총관리 군들의 모습들을\n바라보면서 그분들이 매일매일 그리고 그 시간시간 그 때 그때마다 그분들이 얼마나이\n34절에 바로 그 고대의 몰의 예언자였던 선지자였던 니파이가\n저들에게 주해 주신 그분의 마음을 제가 배울 수가 있었습니다 34절에\n그분은 저희들에게 주여 내가 주를 의뢰 하였사오니 내가 또\n영원히 주를 의뢰하다 내가 육신의 팔에 나의\n신뢰를 두지 아니하리니 이는 육신의에 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자가 저주를 받는 줄 내가 니이다\n참으로 사람에게 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자 육신으로 자기의 팔을 삼는 자는\n저주를 받았나이다이 주님의 종들은 매시간\n시간 매 때마다 그분들은 인간의 팔에 의지하지 않고 고린 가지고 있는 그런\n개인 념이 생이나에 의지지 않고 항상\n주님께 의지하며 주님을 신뢰하며 그분께 그분의 도움을 구하는 모습들을 저는\n지켜보았습니다이 세상에 그 많은 것들이 저희들에게이 세상의 것에이\n사람의 팔에 의지하라고 저희들에게 가르치지만 저희들이 주님께 저의 마음을 돌리고 그분께 신라고 그분을\n신뢰하고 그분의 팔에 의지할 때 참으로 저희들이이 세상이 끝나고 후에도 영원히 오는이 세상에서 저들이\n그분의 축복을 받은 사실 간증 드리면서 여러분들의 수고와 여러분들 신앙 사심에 큰 감사를 드리면서\n여러분이 지치 하식 소망하겠습니다 예수님은 우리들의 그리스도이시며\n저희들의 구세 주님께 간증드립니다 예수 그리스도의 이름으로 간증드립니다 아멘\nFirst, I would like to thank the director for giving me the opportunity to share my testimony with you all.\nAh, a couple of weeks ago, one of our children asked me,\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nI had a chance to think carefully.\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nThe verse that came to mind was the verse in 2 Nephi 4:3 that you all know well. I now look at the living prophet, seer, revelator, my synagogue,\nand also at Elder Cook, who is with us today, and the general officers of the 12 Apostles, and the presidents of the civic garden,\nand how much they\nhave learned every day and every hour and every moment. Nephi\ngave me a glimpse of His heart. In verse 34,\nHe said to them, Lord, I have trusted in Thee, and I will\ntrust in Thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh, for I know that cursed is he who puts his trust in flesh.\nYea, cursed is he who puts his trust in man, who makes flesh his arm.\nThese servants of the Lord, hour by hour,\nThey do not rely on the arm of man, but they do not rely on the arm of life,\nbut they always rely on the Lord, they trust in Him, they ask for His help. I have\nwatched them. There are so many things in this world that teach us to rely on the arms of men,\nbut when we turn our hearts to the Lord, and trust in Him, and rely on His arm,\nwe will truly know that they have received His blessings in this world,\neven after this world is over, and in this world to come, for eternity. As I testify, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your hard work and your faith,\nand I hope that you will be tired. Jesus is our Christ,\nand I testify to our Savior, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

    "text": "3 Decisions in Life\nGrowing up my mother mentioned, a number of times, that her family has practiced medicine - both western and eastern. Without saying directly, she was encouraging me to continue that tradition.\nI could not envision myself as a doctor and I never considered it. Reasoned that in the future, technology would pervade society. Following my sister’s lead1, I chose to study Engineering.\n\nSimilarly my parents didn’t say or give directions on dating and marriage, directly. Their marriage was an arranged marriage. Perhaps it was their response or reaction to past generations’ effort to arrange marriages. Or they were unfamiliar with the new way of courtship.\nHowever when I started dating Korean persons after the mission, they expressed their approval. The challenge became, finding that person of similar heritage that shared the same spiritual direction. There were not that many Koreans that belonged to the church.\n\nThe decision on the spiritual direction was made for me by my parents.\nFrom the earliest days, and it was always cold in those days, we would attend church meetings. I remember walking to 화랑 고회 at night and could hear the animal sound in the distant.\nIt was 장로교회 until missionaries came. Then at age of 8.5 I was baptized along with my siters and my mother.2\nI didn’t question the church or the gospel growing up. I did have a period where I was questioning myself,\nWho am I? What is my purpose in life?\nI am grateful that my parents had the love and patience to help me through this stage."

philosopher and the founder of Taoism. His teachings revolve around the concept of Tao, which can be translated as “The Way” or “The Way of Nature.” Here are some key ideas from Lao Tzu’s teachings:\n\n\n1. Tao: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the Tao, the natural and universal principle that underlies everything in existence. The Tao is seen as an impersonal force that cannot be fully understood or described but can be experienced.\n\n\n2. Wu-wei: Lao Tzu advocated for the principle of Wu-wei, which can be translated as “non-action” or “effortless action.” It involves aligning oneself with the natural flow of the Tao and acting without unnecessary force or resistance. It is about allowing things to unfold naturally rather than trying to control or manipulate them.\n\n\n3. Simplicity and Spontaneity: Lao Tzu emphasized the value of simplicity and spontaneity in life. He believed that by letting go of desires, attachments, and excessive ambition, one can achieve inner peace and harmony. By embracing simplicity and being in tune with the natural rhythms of life, one can live a more fulfilling existence.\n\n\n4. Humility and Detachment: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of humility and detachment. He encouraged individuals to let go of ego and the need for recognition, and instead cultivate a sense of modesty and detachment from material possessions and social status. By doing so, one can attain true wisdom and freedom.\n\n\n5. Paradoxical Thinking: Lao Tzu often employed paradoxical statements to challenge conventional wisdom and encourage deeper reflection. He believed that reality is multifaceted and cannot be fully grasped through dualistic thinking. By embracing paradoxes and transcending binary concepts, individuals can gain a more profound understanding of the nature of existence.\n\n\nOverall, Lao Tzu’s teachings revolve around living in harmony with the natural order, embracing simplicity, acting without force, and cultivating humility and detachment. His philosophy encourages individuals to let go of unnecessary desires and attachments in order to achieve inner peace and align themselves with the profound wisdom of the Tao.\n\n\nBuddhism is a spiritual tradition that originated in ancient India and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. The teachings of Buddhism, often referred to as the Dharma, offer guidance on how to live a meaningful and enlightened life. Here are some key teachings of Buddhism:\n\n\n1. The Four Noble Truths: These are considered the foundational teachings of Buddhism. They are:\n   a. Dukkha (Suffering): Life is characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence.\n   b. Samudaya (Origin of Suffering): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.\n   c. Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering): It is possible to end suffering by letting go of attachments and desires.\n   d. Magga (Path to the Cessation of Suffering): The Noble Eightfold Path leads to the cessation of suffering.\n\n\n2. The Noble Eightfold Path: This path provides practical guidelines for living a moral, balanced, and mindful life. It consists of eight interconnected aspects:\n   a. Right View: Understanding the true nature of reality and the Four Noble Truths.\n   b. Right Intention: Cultivating positive intentions and letting go of harmful thoughts.\n   c. Right Speech: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and avoiding harmful speech.\n   d. Right Action: Acting in ways that are ethical, compassionate, and non-harming.\n   e. Right Livelihood: Engaging in a profession that promotes well-being and avoids harm.\n   f. Right Effort: Cultivating wholesome qualities and letting go of unwholesome ones.\n   g. Right Mindfulness: Developing present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation.\n   h. Right Concentration: Cultivating focused and tranquil states of mind through meditation.\n\n\n3. Impermanence: Buddhism emphasizes the understanding that everything in life is impermanent. All conditioned phenomena, including ourselves, are subject to change and decay. Recognizing this truth helps us let go of attachments and reduces suffering.\n\n\n4. No-Self (Anatta): Buddhism teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. Instead, our existence is characterized by a constantly changing flow of physical and mental processes. Understanding the absence of a fixed self leads to a more liberated and interconnected view of reality.\n\n\n5. Compassion and Loving-kindness: Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings. This includes developing empathy, extending goodwill, and working towards alleviating the suffering of others.\n\n\n6. Mindfulness and Meditation: Buddhism places great emphasis on the practice of mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of one’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Meditation cultivates concentration, insight, and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.\n\n\n7. Karma and Rebirth: Buddhism teaches the concept of karma, which states that our intentional actions have consequences. Positive actions lead to positive outcomes, while negative actions lead to suffering. Buddhism also holds the belief in rebirth, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth until one achieves enlightenment and liberation from this cycle.\n\n\nThese teachings of Buddhism provide a comprehensive framework for individuals to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and inner peace while navigating the challenges of existence. Buddhism encourages personal inquiry, self-reflection, and the development of ethical behavior and mental well-being.\n\n\nChristianity is a major world religion that is centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Its teachings are based on the Bible, particularly the New Testament, and vary across different denominations. Here are some key teachings of Christianity:\n\n\n1. The Nature of God: Christianity teaches the belief in one God who is eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good. God is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe and is revealed as Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit (the Trinitarian nature of God).\n\n\n2. Jesus Christ as Savior: Christianity holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Messiah who came to save humanity from sin and offer eternal life. Jesus’ life, teachings, death on the cross, and resurrection are central to Christian faith and provide redemption and reconciliation with God.\n\n\n3. Salvation through Faith: Christianity teaches that salvation is a gift from God, not something earned by human efforts. It is received through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, acknowledging His sacrificial death and accepting His forgiveness. Christians believe in the importance of repentance, turning away from sin, and receiving God’s grace.\n\n\n4. Love, Compassion, and Morality: Christianity emphasizes the commandment to love God and love one’s neighbor as oneself. Christians are encouraged to show compassion, kindness, forgiveness, and generosity to others. Christian moral teachings encompass a wide range of principles, including honesty, integrity, respect for life, sexual purity, and social justice.\n\n\n5. The Bible as Sacred Scripture: The Bible is considered the inspired Word of God in Christianity. It consists of the Old Testament, which contains the religious texts of Judaism, and the New Testament, which focuses on the life and teachings of Jesus and the early Christian community. The Bible serves as a guide for faith, doctrine, ethics, and spiritual growth.\n\n\n6. Worship and Sacraments: Christianity emphasizes communal worship and the gathering of believers. Worship practices vary across different Christian traditions but often involve prayer, singing hymns, reading scripture, preaching, and participating in sacraments. Sacraments, such as baptism and the Eucharist (also known as Communion or the Lord’s Supper), are considered sacred rituals that convey spiritual grace.\n\n\n7. Resurrection and Eternal Life: Christianity teaches the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which signifies victory over sin and death. Christians have hope in the promise of eternal life and the resurrection of the dead. The final judgment is also a belief in Christianity, where individuals are held accountable for their actions and receive their eternal destiny.\n\n\nThese teachings provide a foundation for Christian faith and practice, focusing on a personal relationship with God, the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, moral living, and the hope of eternal life. Different Christian denominations may have additional beliefs and practices that shape their particular expressions of Christianity.\n\n\nIslam is a monotheistic religion that originated in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. Its teachings are based on the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Here are some key teachings of Islam:\n\n\n1. Oneness of God: Islam emphasizes the belief in the oneness of God, known as Tawhid. Muslims believe in the absolute unity and uniqueness of Allah, who is eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and merciful. Associating partners with God (shirk) is considered a major sin.\n\n\n2. Prophethood: Muslims believe that God has sent prophets throughout history to guide humanity. The final and most significant prophet is Muhammad, who Muslims believe to be the last messenger and the seal of prophethood. The Quran is believed to be the final revelation from God.\n\n\n3. Five Pillars of Islam: These are the core practices that shape the life of a Muslim:\n   a. Shahada: The declaration of faith, which states, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.”\n   b. Salat: The ritual prayer performed five times a day, facing the Kaaba in Mecca.\n   c. Zakat: Giving a portion of one’s wealth to the less fortunate as a form of obligatory charity.\n   d. Sawm: Fasting from dawn to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.\n   e. Hajj: The pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, which is obligatory for those physically and financially able to undertake it.\n\n\n4. Quran as the Word of God: The Quran is considered the literal word of God, revealed in Arabic to Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a guide for Muslims in matters of faith, worship, morality, and daily life. Muslims strive to live in accordance with its teachings and seek guidance from it.\n\n\n5. Moral and Ethical Principles: Islam emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior and the pursuit of righteousness. Muslims are encouraged to be honest, just, compassionate, and kind. They are instructed to avoid lying, stealing, cheating, backbiting, and engaging in any form of harm or injustice.\n\n\n6. Brotherhood and Community: Islam promotes a sense of brotherhood and unity among Muslims. Muslims are encouraged to support and care for one another, and to contribute to the well-being of society. Social justice, equality, and the rights of individuals are emphasized.\n\n\n7. Judgment and Afterlife: Islam teaches that individuals will be held accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment. Believers who have lived a righteous life and followed God’s commands will be rewarded with Paradise, while those who have engaged in evil and rejected God’s guidance may face punishment in Hell.\n\n\nThese teachings provide the foundation for Islamic belief and practice, focusing on the worship of Allah, adherence to moral principles, and the pursuit of a righteous and compassionate life. It is important to note that there are various interpretations and practices within the Islamic tradition, and different cultures and communities may have additional customs and practices that shape their expression of Islam.\n\n\nHinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world, with a rich and diverse set of teachings. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, but there are some fundamental teachings that are commonly emphasized. Here are key teachings of Hinduism:\n\n\n1. Dharma: Dharma refers to the moral and ethical duties and responsibilities that individuals are expected to fulfill in their lives. It encompasses righteousness, duty, and the harmonious functioning of society. Dharma varies according to one’s age, caste, occupation, and stage of life.\n\n\n2. Karma and Reincarnation: Hinduism teaches the concept of karma, which is the law of cause and effect. It states that every action has consequences, and individuals accumulate karma based on their actions in past and present lives. Reincarnation, or the cycle of birth and rebirth, is believed to be influenced by one’s accumulated karma.\n\n\n3. Moksha: Moksha refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. It is the ultimate goal of Hinduism, representing liberation from the cycle of suffering and union with the divine. Moksha is achieved through self-realization, spiritual growth, and the realization of one’s true nature, which is ultimately connected to the divine.\n\n\n4. Atman and Brahman: Hinduism teaches the existence of an eternal, unchanging, and divine essence within all beings, called the Atman. The Atman is considered identical to the ultimate reality, known as Brahman, which is the ultimate source and essence of the universe. Realizing the oneness of Atman and Brahman is a central spiritual pursuit in Hinduism.\n\n\n5. Yogic Practices: Hinduism has a long tradition of various yogic practices aimed at spiritual development and self-realization. Yoga encompasses physical postures (asanas), breath control (pranayama), meditation (dhyana), and ethical disciplines. Different paths of yoga, such as Bhakti Yoga (devotion), Karma Yoga (selfless action), Jnana Yoga (knowledge), and Raja Yoga (meditation), cater to the diverse spiritual needs of individuals.\n\n\n6. Deities and Worship: Hinduism embraces a diverse pantheon of deities, representing different aspects of the divine. Worship practices vary widely, ranging from personal devotional practices (puja) to elaborate temple rituals and festivals. Hindus believe that devotion and sincere worship can lead to a deeper connection with the divine.\n\n\n7. Ahimsa and Non-violence: Hinduism promotes the principle of ahimsa, which is non-violence and compassion towards all living beings. It encourages the practice of non-harm, kindness, and empathy. Ahimsa extends to all aspects of life, including thoughts, words, and actions.\n\n\n8. Unity in Diversity: Hinduism embraces the idea that there are multiple paths to spiritual realization and that different individuals may have different approaches to the divine. It promotes tolerance, acceptance, and respect for diversity of beliefs and practices.\n\n\nIt is important to note that Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion with a wide range of beliefs and practices. Different schools of thought and regional traditions may emphasize certain teachings more than others. The above teachings provide a general overview of the key principles found in Hinduism.\n\n\nJudaism is one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions, with a rich history and set of teachings. Here are some key teachings of Judaism:\n\n\n1. Monotheism: Judaism is based on the belief in one God, who is eternal, all-powerful, and the creator of the universe. This belief in the oneness of God is central to Judaism and is expressed in the declaration of the Shema: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.”\n\n\n2. Covenant: Judaism teaches that God entered into a covenant with the Jewish people, starting with the covenant made with Abraham. The covenant involves a reciprocal relationship, with God’s promises and the Jewish people’s responsibilities. It includes moral obligations, adherence to the commandments, and the observance of Jewish rituals.\n\n\n3. Torah: The Torah is the sacred text of Judaism, consisting of the Five Books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). It contains laws, stories, and ethical teachings that form the foundation of Jewish faith and practice. The Torah is seen as the word of God and serves as a guide for Jewish life.\n\n\n4.
