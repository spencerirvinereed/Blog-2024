    "text": "Transcript \nSpeaker 1 \nWho is supposed to be the arbiter of truth between the human and the computer together, do you think? That AI will actually help us. Let me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans only have relationships? With AI. What is your worst case fear about? All of this. \nSpeaker 2 \nI’m Ivan mahari. I’m a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the author of Nexus, A History of information networks from the Stone Age to AI. If you consider, for instance, that we have managed to reach the Moon to split the atom to the cipher DNA, and yet with all our knowledge and wisdom, we are on the verge of destroying ourselves and a traditional answer to this question. Is that there is something wrong in human nature, but the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. If you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. So why is it that the quality of our information did not improve over thousands of years of history? Why is it that very sophisticated societies in the 20th and 21st century? Have been as susceptible as Stone Age tribes to mass delusion and psychosis, and the rise of destructive ideologies like Stalinism or Nazism. \nSpeaker 1 \nGood. Everybody, thank you for being here. It is a privilege for me to be here with you, Val. I’ve been a long time fan of his back. When Sapiens was first published, and there is so much to talk about. Between then and now, and how we think about AI and how we think about this new reality, something that I think was actually a theme in your earliest books about reality and truth and information. And in a world where it’s going to become all electronic and in a cloud, in the sky, in a whole new way, what it ultimately means when you think about history. So thank you for being. Here we’re going to. Talk about so many things, but I’m going to tell you where we want to start tonight. If I could. I want to read you something. This is you, you said. That humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation. But the way these networks are built. Else predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our problem then is a network problem. You call it, but even more specifically, you say it’s an information problem. I want you. To try to unpack that for the audience this evening, because I think that that more than anything else in this book explains, or at least sets the table for what this discussion is all about. \nSpeaker 2 \nSo basically the the key question of the book, and of much of human history is if we are so smart, why are we so stupid? That’s the key question. I mean, we can, you know, we can reach the moon, we can split the atom, we can create an eye. And yet we are on the verge of destroying ourselves. And not just through one way, like previously. We just said nuclear our war to destroy ourselves. Now we’ve created an entire menu of ways to destroy ourselves. \nSpeaker \nSo. \nSpeaker 2 \nWhat is happening and you know one basic answer in many mythologies is that there is something wrong with human nature. That we reach for powers that we don’t know how to use wisely, that there was really something deeply wrong with us. And the answer that I try to give in the book is that the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. That if you go, if you give good people bad information, they will make bad decisions, self-destructive decisions and this has been happening again and again in history. Because information isn’t truth, and information isn’t wisdom. The most basic function of information is connection. Information connects many people to a network, and unfortunately the easiest way to connect large numbers of people together is not with the truth, but with fictions and fantasies and delusions. \nSpeaker \nWhat it? \nSpeaker 1 \nWas going to say there’s there’s a sense, though, that information was supposed to set us free. Information access to information across the world was the was the thing that was supposed to make us a a better, a better planet. \nSpeaker 2 \nWhy would we do that? \nSpeaker 1 \nWell, there was a sense that people in in, in places that didn’t have access to communication tools and other things didn’t have access to information and didn’t have access and maybe to put a point on it to. Good information. You make the argument and now to go back to Sapiens. Frankly, you talk about different types of realities and this is what I think is very interesting because you talk about objective reality. You know, we can go outside and we can see that it’s not raining and the sky is blue. And you’d say that’s an objective reality, right? But then there are these other kinds of realities that you talk about, which makes us, I think, susceptible to what you’re describing. When I say susceptible this idea that we as a group, as humanity that we are storytellers and that we are OK, oddly enough with what you’ve described as a fictional. Reality. \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah, I mean. To take an example, suppose we want to build an atom bomb. To do that, suppose that’s false. Somebody wants to build an atom bomb. \nSpeaker 1 \nSuppose just. \nSpeaker 2 \nYou need to know some facts to build an atom bomb. You need some hold on objective physical reality. If you don’t know that E equals MC square. If you don’t know the fact of physics, you will not be able to build an atom bomb, but to build an atom bomb you need something else. Besides knowing the fact of physics. You need millions and millions of people. For it. Not just the physicists, but also the miners who mine uranium and the engineers and builders who build the reactor, and the farmers that grow rice and wheat in order to seed all the physicists and engineers and miners and so forth. And how do you get millions of people to cooperate? A project like building an atom bomb, if you just tell them the fact of physics look in equals MC square. Now go to it. Nobody would do it. It’s not inspiring. It it doesn’t mean anything in this sense of giving motivation. You always need to tell them some kind of fiction fantasy and the people who invent the fictions are far more powerful than the people who know the facts, physics. In Iran today, the nuclear physicists are getting their orders from people who are experts in Shiite. In Israel, increasingly, the physicists in the Soviet Union, they got it from Communist ideologues Germany. It’s usually the people who know how to read the story that give orders to the people who merely know. Facts of of of Nuclear Physics and one last point crucial point is that when if you build the bomb and ignore the fact of physics, the bomb will not explode. But if you build a story and ignore the facts of history and biology and whatever, the story still explodes. And usually with a much bigger bank. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd so one of the underlying conceits of this book. In my mind, as a reader is that you believe that AI is going to be used for these purposes? \nSpeaker \nYeah. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd that AI ultimately is going to be used as a storyteller to tell untruths and unwise stories, and that those who have the power behind this AI are going to be able to use it in this way. Do you believe it’s that people are going to use the AI? In the wrong way, or that the AI is going to use the AI in the wrong way? \nSpeaker 2 \nInitially it will be the. People. But if we are not careful, it will get out of our control and it will be the AI. I mean, maybe we start by saying something about the definition of of AI, because it’s now kind of this buzzword which is everywhere and there is so much hype around it that it’s becoming difficult to understand what it is. Whenever they try to sell you something, especially in the financial markets, they tell you it’s an AI. This is an AI chair and this is an AI table. And this is an AI coffee machine. So buy it. And So what is AI? So if you take a coffee machine as an example, not every automatic machine is an AI, even though it knows how to make coffee. When you press a button, it’s not an AI. It’s simply doing whatever it was pre programmed by humans to do for something to be an AI, it needs the ability to learn and change by itself. And ultimately to make decisions and create new ideas by itself. So if you approach the coffee machine and the coffee machine on its own accord tells you, hey, good morning, Andrew. I’ve been watching you for the last couple of weeks. And based on everything I learned about you and your facial expression and then the hour of the day and whatever. I predict that you would like an espresso, so here I made you an espresso. Then it’s an AI and it’s really an AI. If it says an actually, I’ve just invented a new drink called best Pretzel, which is even better. I think you would like it better for it took the liberty to make some for you. When it can make decisions and create new ideas by itself. And once you create something like that, then obviously the potential for it to get out of control and to start manipulating you is there and that’s the big issue. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd so how far away do you think we are from that? \nSpeaker 2 \nWhen Openai developed GPT 4 like two years ago, they did all kinds of tests. What can this thing do? So one of the tests they gave are GPD for was to solve capture puzzles that. When you access. A web page, a bank, or something you may want to know. You’re a human being, or you’re a bot, so you are. You have these twisted letters and symbols. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd this is or the 9 squares and it says which one has something with four legs in it and you see the animal and click the animal. \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. All these kinds of things. Yeah. And GPT 4 couldn’t solve it. But GPD 4 access. Task Rabbit, which is an online site where you can hire people to do. All kinds of things for you. And you know, these captures were developed so humans can solve them. But AI, I still struggle with. So it wanted to hire a human. That’s interesting. The human got suspicious. The human asked why do you need somebody to solve the culture? Puzzles are. You a robot? And at that point, GPT 4 said no, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment, which is why I have difficulty with these captures. \nSpeaker 1 \nSo and how to lie? \nSpeaker 2 \nIt it had basically theory of mind. On some level it it it knew what you know. There’s so many different explanations. And lies you. Can tell, he told a very, very effective lie. It’s the kind of life that occupation improve, but I’m not going to ask any more questions about it. I will just take the word of GPT for for it. And nobody told it to lie, and nobody told it. Which lie will be most effective? It landed. The same way that humans and animals learn things by interacting. With the world. \nSpeaker 1 \nLet me ask you a different. Question. To the extent that. You believe that the computer will be able to do this to us. \nSpeaker 3 \nWill with the. \nSpeaker 1 \nHelp of the computer we be able to avoid these problems on the other side, meaning there’s a cat and mouse game here and and the question is between the human and the computer together, will we be able to be more powerful and maybe power or is good or bad but be able to get at truth? \nSpeaker 2 \nThen. \nSpeaker 1 \nIn a better way. \nSpeaker 2 \nPotentially yes. I mean the the point of talking about it, of writing a book about it is that it’s not too late and that also the AI’s are not inherently evil or malevolent. It’s a question of how we shape this technology. We still have the power. We are still at the present moment. We are still far more powerful than the AIS. They in very narrow domains like playing chess or playing golf. They are becoming more intelligent than us, but we still have a huge edge. Nobody knows for how many more years, so we need to use it and make sure that we direct the development of this technology. Are in in a safe. Direction. OK, so. \nSpeaker 1 \nI’m going to make you king for the day. What would you do? How would you? Would you regulate these things? How what? What is it exactly in? In an environment. And world where we don’t have global regulators, we don’t have people who like to interact and even talk to each other anymore. Frankly, where we’ve talked about regulating social media, at least in the United States for the past 15 years now. And have done next to nothing. How we would get there, what that looks like? \nSpeaker 2 \nYou know, there are many regulations we should enact right now and we can talk about that. One key regulation is make social media corporations liable for the actions of their algorithms, not for the actions of their users and for the. Sections of the the corporate algorithms and another key regulation that AIS cannot pretend to be human beings. They can interact with us only if they identify as AIS. But beyond all these specific regulations, the key thing is institutions. Nobody is able to predict. How this is going to play out, how this is going to develop in the next 5-10, fifty years? So any any thought that we can now kind of regulate in advance it’s it’s impossible. No rigid regulation will be able to deal with what we are facing. We need living institutions. That have the best human talent and also the best technology. That can identify problems as they develop and react on the fly, and we are living in an era in which there is growing hostility towards institutions. But what we’ve learned again and again throughout history, is that all institutions are able to deal with these things, not single. Individuals and not some kind of miracle regulations. \nSpeaker 1 \nPlay it out. What is the the and and you play it out in the book a little bit when it comes to dictators and your real fears. What is the your worst case fear about? \nSpeaker \nOK. \nSpeaker 1 \nAll of this. \nSpeaker 2 \nOne of the problems with AI is that there isn’t just like this single nightmare scenario with nuclear weapons. One of the good things about nuclear weapons it it was very easy for everybody to understand the danger, because there was basically one extremely dangerous scenario. Nuclear war. With AIS, because they are, they are not tools like atom bombs, they are agents. That that’s the most important thing to understand about them. An atom bomb, ultimately, is a tool in our hand. All decisions about how to use it and how to develop it. Humans make these decisions. AI is not a tool in our hand. It’s an autonomous agent. That, as I said, can make decisions and can invent ideas by itself, and therefore by definition, there are hundreds of dangerous scenarios that are many of them we cannot predict because they are coming from a non human intelligence. But think differently than us. You know the the acronym AI. It traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it should stand for alien intelligence. Not in the sense that coming from outer space in the sense that it’s an alien kind of intelligence, it thinks. Differently than a human being, and it’s not artificial because an artifact, again, is something that we create and. Small and this is now as the potential to go way beyond what we can predict and control still from all the different scenarios, the one which I think are speaks to to my deepest fears and also to to humanity’s deepest fears is. Being trapped. In a world of delusions created by AI, you know the fear of robots rebelling against humans and shooting people and whatever. This is very new. This goes back a couple of decades, maybe to the mid 20th. But for thousands of years, humans have been haunted by a much deeper fear. We know that our societies are ultimately based on stories. And there was always the fear that we will just be trapped inside the world of illusions and delusions and fantasies, which we mistake for reality. And will not be able to escape from, but will lose all touch with truth with reality. \nSpeaker 1 \nPart of that exists today. \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. And, you know, it goes back to the parable of The Cave in Platos to losophy of a group of prisoners chained in a cave facing a blank wall, a screen. And there are shadows projected on this screen and they mistake the shadows for reality. And you have the same fears in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy of the world of Maya. The world of illusions. And AI is kind of the perfect tool. To create it. We are already seeing it being created all around. If the main metaphor of the early Internet age was the web, the World Wide Web and the web connects everything. So now the main metaphor is the cocoon. It’s the web which closes on us, and I live inside 1 information. And you live inside maybe a different information cocoon and there is absolutely no way for us to communicate because we live in separate different reality. \nSpeaker 1 \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies, and let me read you something from the book because I think it speaks to maybe even this election here in the United States, the definition of democracy as a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms stands in sharp contrast to a common misconception. That equates democracy only with elections. Elections are a central part of the Democratic toolkit, but they are not democracy. In the absence of additional self correcting mechanisms, elections can easily be rigged. Even if the elections are completely free and fair by itself, this too doesn’t guarantee democracy for democracy is not the same thing as. And this one’s interesting. Majority dictatorship. What do you? Bye, Matt. \nSpeaker 2 \nWhat many things, but I mean on the most basic level, just so in Venezuela that you can hold elections and if the dictator has the power to rig the elections, so it means nothing. The great advantage of democracy is that it corrects itself. It has this mechanism that you try something, but people try something. They vote for a party for a leader. Let’s try this bunch of policies for a couple of years. If it doesn’t work well, we can now try something else. That the the basic ability to say we made the mistake, let’s try something else. This is democracy. In putting Russia, you cannot say that we made a mistake. Let’s let’s try somebody else in democracy. You can. But there is a problem here. You give so much power for limited time. You give so much power. To a leader, to a party. To enact certain policies. But then what happens is that leader or party utilizes the power that the people gave them not to enact a specific time limited policy, but to gain even more power and to make it impossible to get rid of them anymore. It was always one of the key problems of democracy that you can use democracy to gain power and then use the power you have to destroy democracy. Everyone said it in in Turkey, I think best that, he said. Democracy is like a tram, like a. Train you take it until you reach the destination, then you go down. You don’t stay on the train. Ah. And. For most of history, large scale democracy was really impossible because democracy in essence is a conversation between a large number of people. And in the ancient world, you could have this conversation in a tribe, in a village, in a city state like Athens or Republican Rome. But you could not have it in a large Kingdom with millions of people because there was no technical means to hold the conversation. So we don’t know of any example. Of a large scale democracy before the rise of modern information technology in the late modern age, so democracy is built on top of information tech. Logic and when there is a big change in information technology like what is happening right now in the world, there was an earthquake. In the structure built on top of it. \nSpeaker 1 \nWho was supposed to be the arbiter of truth in these democracies? And the reason I raised this issue is we we have a big debate going on in this country right now about free speech and how much information we’re supposed to know what access to information we’re supposed to get. \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. \nSpeaker 1 \nMark Zuckerberg just came out a couple weeks ago and said that, you know, there was information during the pandemic that he was suppressing that in retrospect, he wishes now he wasn’t suppressing. \nSpeaker 2 \nMm-hmm. \nSpeaker 1 \nThis gets to the idea of truth, and it also gets to the idea of what information you said. Information is not. Truth, yeah. Are we supposed to get access to all of it and decipher what’s real ourselves? Is somebody else supposed to do it for us? And will AI? Ultimately, be that arbiter. \nSpeaker 2 \nSo there are a couple of of of of different questions here, one about free speech and the other about who is supposed to most important thing is that free speech includes the freedom to tell lies, to tell fictions, to tell fantasies. So it’s not the same as the question of truth. Ideally, in the democracy you also have the. Freedom to lie. You also have the freedom to spread directions. \nSpeaker 1 \nThe ideal is why is that ideal? \nSpeaker 2 \nAnd and this is something that is crucial to understand, because the tech giants, they are constantly confusing the question of truth with the question of free speech. And there are two different questions. We don’t want a kind of truth police that constantly tells human beings what they can and cannot say. There are, of course limits even to that, but ideally yes, people should be able to also tell fictions and fantasies and so forth. This is information, it’s not true. The crucial role. Of this feeling out of this ocean of information. The rare and costly kind of information, which is truth. This is the role of several different, very important institutions in society. This is the role of scientists. This is the role of journalists. This is the role of judges. And the role or the aim of these institutions is not to limit the freedom of speech of the of the people, but to tell us what is the truth. Now the problem we now face is that there is a sustained. Attack. On these institutions and on the very notion that there is truth because the dominant worldview in large parts of both the left and the right on the left takes a mouse’s shape, and on the right the populist shape. They tell us that the only reality is power. All, all the world, all the universe, all reality is just power. The only thing humans want humans want is power and any human interaction like we have in this conversation is just a power struggle. And in every such interaction, when somebody tells you something. The question to ask, and this is what Donald Trump meets Karl Marx, and they shake hands. They agree on that when somebody tells you something, the question to ask is not what is. Is it true? There is no such thing. The question to ask is who is winning and who is losing? Whose privileges like what I have just said, whose privileges are being served by. And the idea is that when scientists, journalists, judges, people at large, they are only in pursuing power. And this is an extremely cynical and destructive view which undermines all institutions. Luckily, it’s not true. Especially when we look at ourselves, if we start to understand humanity just by looking at ourselves, most people will say yes, I want some power in life, but it’s not the only thing I want. I actually want truth. Also, I want to know the truth about myself, about my life. The truth about the world, and the reason that there is this deep yearning for truth, is that you can’t really be happy. If you don’t know the truth about yourself and about your life, if you look at these, people are obsessed with power. People like Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump, they have a lot of power. They don’t seem to be particularly happy. And when you realize that I’m a human being and I I really want to know at least some truth about life, why isn’t it true also of others? And yes, there are problems in institutions. There are, there is corruption, there is influence. And so. But This is why we have a lot of different institutions. \nSpeaker 1 \nI’m going to throw another name at you. You talked about Putin, you talked about Trump, you talked about Netanyahu. He’s not a politician, but he might want to be some. Point. Elon Musk. \nSpeaker \nHmm. \nSpeaker 1 \nWhere do you put him in this? And the reason I ask? Talking about truth and information, he’s somebody who said that he wants to set all information free because he believes that if the information is free, he says that you, all of us, will be able to find and get to the. Truth, there are others. \nSpeaker 2 \nMHM. \nSpeaker 1 \nWho believe that all of that information. It will obscure the truth. \nSpeaker 2 \nI think that it’s a very naive view of information and truth. The idea that you just open the floodgates and let information flood the world and the truth will somehow rise to the top. You don’t know anything about history. If this is what? You think? It just doesn’t work like that. The truth? Again, it’s costly. It’s well, like, if you want to write a true story in the newspaper or an academic paper or whatever, you have to research so much. It’s very difficult. Takes a lot of time, energy, money. If you want to create some fiction, it’s the easiest thing in the world. Similarly, the truth is often very complicated because reality is very complicated, whereas fiction and fantasy can be made as simple as possible, and people in most cases they like simple stories and the truth is often painful. Whether you think about and the truth about entire countries. \nSpeaker 1 \nRight. \nSpeaker 2 \nOr the truth about individuals. The truth is often unattractive. It’s painful. We don’t want to know. For instance, the pain that we inflict sometimes on people in our life or on ourselves. Because the truth is, is costly and it’s complicated and it can be painful in a completely kind of free fight. It will lose. This is why we need institutions. Like newspapers or like academic institutions, and once again something very important about the tech giants. My problem with Facebook and and and Twitter and so forth. I don’t expect them to censor their users. We have to be very, very careful about censoring the expression of real human beings. My problem is the algorithms. Yes, even the even when they’re not telling the truth, we’re very careful about censoring the the the, the free expression of human beings. My problem is with the algorithms. \nSpeaker 1 \nEven when they’re telling the truth, even when they’re telling untruths. \nSpeaker 2 \nThat if you look at the historical case, like the massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar in 20/16/2017, in which thousands of of people were murdered, 10s of thousands were raped, and hundreds of thousands were expelled and are still refugees in Bangladesh and elsewhere. This ethnic cleansing campaign was fueled by a propaganda campaign that are generated intense hatred among Buddhists, bunnies in Myanmar against the Rohingya. Now this campaign to a large extent took place on Facebook. And the Facebook algorithms played a very central role in it. Now, whenever these accusations have been made and they have been made by amnesty in the United Nations and so forth. Facebook basically said, but we don’t want to censor the free expression of people that all these conspiracy theories about the Rohingya, that they are all terrorists and they want to destroy us. They were created by human beings. And who are we? Facebook. The fans of them. And the problem there is that the role of the algorithms. Was at that point was not in creating the stories, it was in disseminating in spreading particular stories, because people in Myanmar were creating a lot of different kinds of content. In 20/16/2017, the war hate filled conspiracy theories, but there are also sermons on compassion. In cooking lessons and biology lessons and so much content. And in the battle between for human attention, what will get the attention of the users in Myanmar, the algorithms of the Kingmakers and the algorithms were given by Facebook. A clear and simple goal. Increase user engagement. Keep more people, more time on the platform because this is the basis for once still is for, for Facebook. ’S business model. Now the algorithms and this goes back to AIS that make decisions by themselves and invent ideas by themselves. Nobody in Facebook wanted them to be an ethnic cleansing campaign. Most of them didn’t know anything about Myanmar and what was happening there. They just told the algorithms, increased user engagement, and the algorithms experimented on millions of human Guinea pigs. And they discovered that if you press the hate button and the seal but. In the human mind, you keep that human glued to the screen, so they deliberately started spreading hate filled conspiracy theories and not. Cooking lessons or summers on on compassion and this is the expectation, don’t censor. The users, but if your algorithms deliberately spread hate and fear because this is your business model, it’s on you. This is your fault. \nSpeaker 1 \nOK. But I’m gonna make it more complicated. I’m going to make it more complicated. And the reason we we’re talking about Facebook and and Elon Musk. Is that the algorithms that are effectively building these new AI agents are scraping all of this information. Off of these sites, this human user generated content which we’ve decided everybody should be able to see, except once the AI’s see it, they will see the conspiracy theories. They will see the misinformation and the question is how the AI agent will ever learn what’s real and what’s not. \nSpeaker 2 \nThat is a very, very old question that you know the editor of. The New York. Times the editor of the Wall Street Journal have dealt with this question before. Why do we need to start again? As if there has never been any history? Like the question, there is so much information out there. How should I know what’s true or not? People have been there before. If you run Twitter or Facebook, you are running one of the biggest media companies in the world, so take a look at what media companies have been dealing with in the previous generations and previous centuries. It’s basic. \nSpeaker 1 \nThey should be liable for what’s on their sites right now. \nSpeaker 2 \nThe the tech companies. \nSpeaker 1 \nThe tech companies should be liable for for the user generated content. \nSpeaker 2 \nThey should be. Liable. No, they should be liable for the actions of their algorithms. If their algorithms decided to put at the top of the news feed a hate filled conspiracy theory, it’s on them not on the person who created the conspiracy theory in the 1st place. The same way that you know, like the chief editor of the New York Times, designed to put a hateful conspiracy theory at the top of the of the first page of the New York Times. And when you come and and tell them what have you done, they say I haven’t done anything. I didn’t write it. I just decided to put it on the front page of the New York Times. That’s all. That’s not. That’s a huge thing. Editors have a lot more power than the authors to create the. Very cheap to create content. The really key point is what gets the attention. You know, I’ll give you an example from thousands of years ago. That when Christianity began. There were so many. Stories circulating about Jesus and about the disciples and about the Saint. Anybody could invent a story in that, Jesus said. And there was no Bible. There was no New Testament in the time of Jesus or 100 years after Jesus or even 200 years after Jesus. There are lots and lots of stories and texts and parable. At a certain point. The leaders of the Christian Church in the 4th century, they said this cannot go on like this. We have to have some order in this flood of information. How would Christians know what information to value, which texts to read and what are forgeries of whatever that they should just ignore? And their hands are two church councils in Hippo and in Carthage today in Tunisia in the late 4th century. And this is where they they didn’t write the texts. The texts were written generations previously, but so many different people. They decided what will get into the Bible and what will stay out. The book didn’t come down from heaven in its coming complete fall. There was a committee that decided which of all the texts will get in and, for instance, they decided that are a text which claimed to be written by Saint Paul. But many scholars today believe that it wasn’t written by Saint Paul. The First Epistle to Timothy. Which was a very misogynistic text which said basically the role of women is to be silent and to build children. This got into the Bible, whereas another text, the acts of Paul and Thecla, which portrayed Sheckler as a disciple of Saint Paul, are preaching and leading the Christian. Community and doing miracles and so forth. They said. Nah, let’s leave that one out. And the views of billions of Christians for almost 2000 years. About women and their capacities and their role in the church in the community, it was decided and not by the authors of First Timothy and the Act of politics. But by this church committee, who sat in what is today Tunisia and went over all these things and decided this will be in, and this will be out, this is enormous power. The power of curation, the editorial power, you know, you think about the the role of newspapers in, in, in, in modern politics. It’s the editors who have the most power learning before he was dictator of the Soviet Union is one job, was chief editor of Isra. And Mussolini also first was a journalist when he was editor. Immense power and now the editors increasingly are the algorithms. You know, I’m here partly on. The book too. And I know that my number one customer. Is is the algorithm? Like if I can get the algorithm to recommend my book, the humans will follow. So is it an immense power? And. That’s above my pay grade. I mean, I’m just sitting here on the stage talking with you. We’ll do this. We’ll do that, we’ll. Put it like this. Realize the immense power of the recommendation algorithm. The editor this comes with responsibility. So then I don’t think that we should hold Twitter or Facebook responsible for what the users, right. And we should be very careful about censoring users even when they say when they write lines. But we should hold the companies responsible for the choices. And the decisions of their algorithms. \nSpeaker 1 \nYou talked now about Lenin, and we’ve talked about all sorts of dictators. One of the things. You talk about in the book is the prospect. That AI could be used to turn a democracy into totalitarian state? Yeah, I thought was fascinating. Because it would really require AI to cocoon all of us in a unique way, telling some kind of story that captures an entire country. How would that work in your mind? \nSpeaker 2 \nAnd then we don’t see reality. We see the information. That we are exposed. And if you have better technology to to create and to control information, you have a much more powerful technology to control humans. Previously, there was always limitations to how much a central authority could control what people see and think and do. Even if you think about the most totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. Like the US saw or Nazi Germany, they couldn’t really follow everybody all the time. It was technically impossible. Like if you have 200 million Soviet citizens to follow them around all the time, 24 hours a day, you need about 400 million KGB. Agents because even KGB agents need to sleep. Sometimes they need to eat. Sometimes they need 2 shifts. So 200 million citizens. You need 400 million. Agents you don’t. Have 400 million KGB agents, even if you. You still have a bigger problem because let’s say that two agents follow each citizen 24 hours a day. What are they doing? The end, they write a report. This is like 1940 or 1960. It’s paper. They write a paper report. So every day KGB headquarters in Moscow is flooded. With 200 million reports about each citizen where they went, what they read, who they meant, somebody needs to analyze all the information they where do they get the analysts? It’s absolutely impossible, which is why even in the Soviet Union. Privacy will feel the default. You never knew who is watching and who is listening, but most of the time nobody was watching and listening. And even if they were, most likely the report about you would be buried in some place in the archives of the KGB. Nobody would ever read it. Now both problems of surveillance are solved by AI to follow all the people of the country 24 hours a day, you do not need millions of human agents. You have all these digital agents, the smartphones, the computers, the microphones and so forth. You can put the whole population under 24 hour surveillance and you don’t need human analysts to analyze all the information you have. AI INS to do it? \nSpeaker 1 \nWhat do you make of the idea that an entire generation has given up on? The idea of privacy. Right. We all put our pictures on Instagram and Facebook and all of these sites we hear about a security hack at some website and we go back the next day and try to buy and put our credit card on the same site again. We say that we’re very anxious about privacy. We we. \nSpeaker 2 \nWe love to. \nSpeaker 1 \nTell people how anxious we are about the. And then we do things that are the complete opposite. \nSpeaker 2 \nBecause there is. Immense pressure on us to do them. Part of it is is despair. And people still cherish privacy and part of the problem is that we haven’t seen the consequences yet yet yet we will see them quite soon. It’s like this huge experiment conducted on billions of of human Guinea pigs, but we still haven’t seen the consequences of this. Annihilation. Of privacy and it is extremely, extremely dangerous. Again, going back to the freedom of speech issue, part of this crisis of freedom of speech is the erosion of the difference between private and public. That there is a big difference. If there’s just the two of us are sitting alone somewhere talking just you and me. Or if there is an entire audience and it’s public now, I’m a very big believer in the right to stupidity. People have a right to be stupid in private. But when you talk in private with your best friends, with your family, whatever you have a right to be really stupid, to be offensive as a gay person, I would say that even politicians, if they tell homophobic jokes in a private situation with their friends, this is none of my business. And it’s actually good that politicians would have situations where they can just relax and say the first stupid thing that pops up in the. This should not happen in public. \nSpeaker 1 \nNow it’s going to be entered into the. \nSpeaker \n1. \nSpeaker 2 \nAlgorithm. Yes, and this inability. To know what that anything they say, even in private, cannot go viral. So there is no difference, and this is extremely harmful. Part of what’s happening now in the world is this kind of tension. Between organic animals, we are organic animals and an inorganic digital system which is increasingly controlling and shaping the entire world. Now part of being an organic entity is that you live by cycles, day and night. Winter and summer growth and decay. Sometimes you are active, sometimes you need to relax and to rest. Are algorithms and AIS and computers? They are not organic, they never need rest. They are on all the time. And the big question is whether we adapt to them or they adapt to us and and more and more. Of course we have to adapt to them. We have to be on all the time. The new cycle is always on and everything we see, even when we are supposedly relaxing with friends, it can be public. So the whole of life becomes like this one long job. Any stupid thing you did in some college when you are 18, it can meet you down the road. And this is destructive. To how we function. We even think about the market like Wall Street. As far as I know, it’s open Monday to Friday is 9:30 to 4:00 in the afternoon, likely from Friday at 5 minutes past four, a new war erupted in the Middle East. The market will react only on Monday. It is still running by organic cycles now. What would happen to human bankers and finance citizens? What is happening when the market is always active? You can never relax. \nSpeaker 3 \nWe’ve got some. \nSpeaker 1 \nQuestions I think that are going to come out here on, on cards, which I want to ask in just a moment. I have a couple of questions before we get to them. One is, have you talked to folks like Sam Altman who runs open AI or the folks at Microsoft and Know Bill Gates was a big fan of your books in the past or the folks at Google? What do they say? When you discuss this with them, and do you trust them as humans when you’ve met them, do you go? I trust you, Sam Altman. \nSpeaker 2 \nMost of them are afraid they understand. \nSpeaker 1 \nAfraid of you or afraid of AI? \nSpeaker 2 \nAfraid of what? What they are doing? Afraid of what is happening. They understand better than anybody else their potential, including the destructive potential of what they are creating. And they are very afraid of it. At the same time, their basic stick is that I’m a good guy and I’m very concerned about it. Now you have these other guys, they are bad. They don’t have the same kind of responsibilities that I have. So it would be very bad for humanity if they create it first. So I must be the one. Operated first and you can trust me that I will know. I will at least do my best. To to to keep it under and everybody else saying it. And I think that to to some extent they are genuine about it. There is of course also this. Another element in in there of extreme kind of pride and hubris, but they are doing the most important thing in basically not just the history of humanity, the history of life. \nSpeaker 1 \nDo you think they are? \nSpeaker 2 \nThey could be, yes, if you think about the timeline of the universe, at least as far as. We know it. So you have basically two stops. First, stop 4 billion years ago, the first organic life forms in merge on Planet Earth, and then for 4 billion years nothing major happens. Like for four million years. It’s more of the same. It’s more organic stuff. So you have amoebas and you have dinosaurs and you have. Humans, but it’s all organic. And then here comes Elon Musk, or some Altman, and that’s the second important thing in the history of the universe. The beginning of inorganic evolution. Because AI is just the very, very beginning of its evolutionary process, is basically like 10 years or 15 years old. We haven’t seen anything yet deep 4:00 and all these things, they are the amoebas of AI evolution. And who knows how the AI dinosaurs are going to look like, but the the name. On the inflection point of the history of the universe, if that name is Elon Musk or that name is sent out, one that’s a big thing. \nSpeaker 1 \nWe’ve got a a bunch of really great questions and actually one of them is where I wanted to go before we even got to these. So we’re just go straight to it. We’re gonna make. It’s actually a bit of a right turn of a question given the conversation, though, you mentioned that Netanyahu on point. So the question here on the card says you’re Israeli. Do you really think that the Israel Palestinian conflict is solvable? And I thought actually that was an important question because it actually touches on some of these larger issues that you’ve raised about humanity. \nSpeaker 2 \nSo on on one level, absolutely yes, it’s not like one of these kind of mathematical problems that we have and mathematical proof that there is no solution to this problem. No, there are all solutions to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It is because it’s not a conflict about objective reality. It’s not a conflict about land or food or resources that you say, OK, there is just not enough food. Somebody have to starve to death or there is not enough land. Somebody has to be thrown in. See, this is not the case. There is enough food between the Mediterranean and Jordan to feed everybody. There is enough energy. There is even enough land. Yes, it’s a very crowded place, but technically there is enough space to build houses and synagogues and mosques and factories and hospitals and schools for everybody. So there is no objective. Voltage. But you have people each in their own information cocoon, each with their own mass delusion, each with their own fantasy, are basically denying either the existence of the other side or the right of the other side to exist. And the war is basically an attempt. To make the other side disappear, like my mind, there’s no space in it. It’s not that the land has no space for the people. My mind has no space in it for the other people. So I will try to make them disappear the same way they don’t exist in my mind. They also must not exist. In reality. And this is on both sides. And again, it’s not an objective problem. It’s a problem of what is inside the minds of people, and therefore there there is a solution to it. Unfortunately, there is no motivation. \nSpeaker 1 \nWhat is the solution? For someone who grew up there who’s lived there? You’re. You’re not there right now. Right, I’m here, right? Now you’re here right now. \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. \nSpeaker \nNo. \nSpeaker 2 \nAgain, if you go back, say, to the two state solution, it’s it’s completely workable solution in objective terms. And you can divide the land and you can divide the resources so that side by side you have a Palestinian state and you have an Israel and Israel and they are both. They both exist and they are both viable and they both provide security and prosperity and dignity to their citizens, to their inhabitants. \nSpeaker 1 \nHow how would you? How would you do that though, because part of the part of the issue is is a chicken and egg issue here, it seems like where the Israelis or Netanyahu would say, look, unless we are fully secure and we feel completely good about our security, we can’t really even. \nSpeaker \nWhat? \nSpeaker 1 \nEntertain a conversation just about anything else, right? And the. Palestinians on the. Other side effectively say the opposite, which is to say that we need. You you need to. Solve our our our issues here. \nSpeaker 2 \nBoth sides of the problems both sides are right. Each side thinks that the other side is trying to annihilate it, and both are right. This is the problem. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd both are right, but tell them that’s. A problem if both are right. \nSpeaker 2 \nOur minds it’s very difficult to change the minds of other people, the first crucial. That is to say, these are the people. They exist, and they have the right to exist. The issue is that both sides suspect that they don’t think that we should exist any compromise that they would make is just because they are now a bit weak. So they will are willing to compromise on something, but deep in their hearts they think we should not exist, so that sooner or later, when they are stronger, when they have the opportunity, they will destroy us. And again, this is correct. This is what is in the hearts and minds of both sides. So the place. Start is to you know inside first our heads. Come to recognize that the other side exists and it has a right to exist that even if someday will have the power to completely annihilate them, we shouldn’t do it because they have a right to exist. And this is something. We can do for us. \nSpeaker 1 \nOK, let me ask you, let me ask you a question. I think. People in Israel would say that people in Palestine have a right to exist. \nSpeaker \nYeah. \nSpeaker 1 \nThere is a you don’t believe that you don’t. You think that’s not? \nSpeaker 2 \nThe case, unfortunately for a significant percentage of the citizens of Israel and certainly of the members of the present governing coalition, this is not the case. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd you think they have no right to exist? Because I was going to say they would say that they feel that the Palestinians. \nSpeaker 2 \nThey. \nSpeaker 1 \nWant to annihilate them and do you? \nSpeaker 2 \nBelieve that yes, they. And then they think that the Palestinians want to annihilate us and they are right. They do want to annihilate us. But also again, I would say I don’t have the numbers to give you, but a significant part of the Israeli public and a very significant part of the. Current ruling coalition in Israel, they want to drive the Palestinian completely from from the land. And maybe they say we are now too weak, so we can’t do it. We have to compromise them only to do a little bit. But ultimately this is what they really think and want and at least some members of the coalition are completely open about it and their messianic fantasy. They actually want a bigger and bigger. War. They want to set the entire Middle East on fire. Because they think that when the smoke would clear, yes, there will be hundreds of thousands of casualties. It will be very difficult. It will be terrible, but in the end we’ll have the entire land to ourselves and there will not be any more Palestinians between the Mediterranean and and the Jordan. \nSpeaker 1 \nLet me ask you one other very political question as it relates to this and actually we have a great segue back into our conversation about AI as it happens. Politically here in the US, we have an election. \nSpeaker 2 \nMHM. \nSpeaker 1 \nAnd there’s some very interesting questions about how former President Trump, if he were to become the president, would be good or bad for Israel. I think there’s a perception that he would be good for Israel. You. May disagree and what you think, Vice President Harris, if she was the president, would be good or bad for Israel, or good or bad. For the Palestinians. How do you see that? \nSpeaker 2 \nAnd I I can’t predict what each will decide, but it’s very clear that President Trump is undermining the global order. He’s in favor of chaos. He is in favor of destroying the liberal global order that we had for the previous couple of decades and which provided the with all the problems with all the difficulties, the most peaceful era in human history. And when you destroy order then you have no alternatives. What you get is chaos. And I don’t think that chaos is good for Israel or that chaos is good for, for the, for the. Jews for the Jewish people. And This is why I think that it will be very even from a very kind of transactional, very narrow perspective. You know, America is a long, long way from Israel, from the Middle East. An isolationist America that withdraws from the world order is not good news for Israel. \nSpeaker 1 \nSo what do you say to the there are there? Are there are a number of American Jews who say, and I’m Jewish and I I this is not something that I say, but I hear it constantly. They say Trump would be good for the Jews. Trump would be good for Israel. He would protect Israel. \nSpeaker 2 \nIn in in what way? \nSpeaker 1 \nHe would have a open checkbook and send the military arms and everything that was asked no questions as. \nSpeaker 2 \nLong as it serves his interests and if at a particular point it serves his interests to make a deal with Putin or with Iran or with anybody. It is really expense. You will do it. \nSpeaker 1 \nFair enough. \nSpeaker 2 \nI mean, he’s not committed. \nSpeaker 1 \nI asked the question to provoke an answer. Let me ask you. Let me ask you this, and this is a great segue back into the conversation we’ve been having the last hour you’ve written about. Human how humans have evolved to pursue power. And and knowledge but. Power, I think, is the big focus. How does the pursuit? Of happiness fit into the narrative. \nSpeaker 2 \nHmm. And I I don’t think that humans are kind of obsessed only with power. I think that power is relatively superficial thing in the human condition. It’s a means to achieve various ends. It’s it’s not necessarily bad, it’s not that power is always bad. No, it can be used for good. It can be used for bad. But the deep motivation of humans, I think, is the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of truth, which are related to one another, because you can never really be happy if you don’t know the truth about yourself, about your life. Unfortunately, as often happens, the means becomes an end. That people become obsessed with power, not with what they can do with it. That immense power, and they don’t know what to do with it. All they do with it, very bad things. \nSpeaker 1 \nThis is this is an interesting one. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans no longer have relationships with other humans and only have relationships with AI? \nSpeaker 2 \nHmm. One thing to say about it is that AI is becoming better and better at understanding our feelings, our emotions, and therefore of developing relationships and intimate relationships with us. Because there is a deep yearning in human beings to be under. Food we always want people to understand us, to understand how we feel. We want my husband, my parents, my teachers, my boss, to understand how I feel. And very often we are disappointed. They don’t understand how I, how I feel, partly because they are too preoccupied with their own feelings to care about my feel. Thanks. AI’s will not have this problem. They don’t have any feelings of their own, and they can be 100% focused on deciphering, on analyzing your feelings. So you know, in these all these science fiction movies in which the robots are extremely cold and mechanical and they can’t understand the most basic human emotion. It it’s it’s a complete opposite. Part of the issue we are facing is that they will be so good at understanding human emotions and reacting in a way which is exactly calibrated to your personality at this particular moment that we might become exasperated with the human beings. We don’t have this capacity. To understand our emotions and to react in in such. A calibrated way. There is a very big question which we didn’t deal with and it it it’s a long question of whether AI’s will develop. Emotions, feelings of their own, whether they become conscious or not. At present, we don’t see any sign of it. But even if AI’s don’t develop any feelings of their own, once we become emotionally attached to them. It is likely that we would start treating them as our conscious entities as sentient beings, and will confirm confirm them. The legal status of of persons you know in in the US there is actually a legal path already open for that. Are corporations according to U.S. law, are legal persons. They have rights, their freedom of freedom of speech. For instance. Now you can incorporate an AI. When you incorporate a corporation like Google or Facebook or whatever up and until today, this was to some extent just make believe because all the decisions of the corporations had to be made by human beings, by the executives, the lawyers, the accountants. What happens if you incorporate an AI? It’s not a legal person, and it can make decisions by itself. It doesn’t need any human team to run it. So you start having legal persons, let’s say in the US, which are not human. And in many ways are more intelligent than us, and they can start making money, for instance, going on task rabbit and offering their services to various things like writing texts. So they earn money, and then they go to the to to, to, to the market they go to Wall Street and they invest that money. And because they’re so intelligent. Maybe they make billions and so you have a situation in which perhaps the richest person. In the US, is not a human being, and part of their rights is that they have honest final speech, the right to make political contributions. So this AI person can contribute billions of dollars to some candidate in exchange for getting more rights to AIS. \nSpeaker 1 \nNow lobby is. Where is this going? So there’ll be an AI president. I’m hoping you’re going to leave. Me. Leave all of us. Maybe on a high note here with something optimistic. Here’s the question, and it’s my final question. Humans are not always able to think from other perspectives. Is AI able to think from multiple perspectives? I think the answer is yes, but do you think that AI will actually help us think this way? \nSpeaker 2 \nYeah. That’s one of the positive scenarios about AI that they will help us understand ourselves better. That their immense power will be used not to manipulate us, but to help us. And then we have historical precedents for that. Like we have relationships with our humans, like doctors, like lawyers, accountants, therapists that are know a lot of things about us. Some of, like our most private information, is held by these people and they have a fiduciary duty to use our private information and their expertise to help us. And this is not. You don’t need to invent the wheel, this is already there, and it’s obvious that if they use it to manipulate us, or if they sell it to a third party to manipulate us, it’s basically against the law. They can go to prison for that, and we should have the same thing with with AI. And we talked a lot about the dangers of AI. But obviously AI has enormous positive potential, otherwise we would not be developing it. It could provide us with the best healthcare and history it could prevent both car accidents. It it can also you know you can have an armies of AI doctors and teachers and therapists who help us. Including help us understand our own humanity, our own relationships, our own emotions better. This can happen if we make the right decisions in the. Next few years. I would end maybe by saying that again the, the, the, the it’s not that we lack the power. At the present moment, what we lack is the understanding and the attention. This is potentially the biggest technological revolution in history, and it’s moving extremely fast, but that’s the key problem. It’s just moving extremely fast. If you think about the US elections the coming weeks, elections. So whoever wins the elections over the next four years, some of the most important decisions they will have to make. Would be about AIS. And regulating AI’s and AI safety and and and and so forth. And it’s not one of the main issues in the presidential debates. It’s not even clear what is the difference, if there is one between Republicans and Democrats on AI, so on specific issues, we start seeing differences. When it comes to issues of freedom of speech and regulation and so forth, but about the broader question, it’s it’s it’s not clear at all. And again, the the biggest danger of all is that we will just rush forward without thinking and without developing the mechanisms to to to, to slow down or to stop if necessary. You know, if you think about it like like a car. So when they told me how to drive a car, the first thing I learned is how to use the brakes. But the first thing that I think that teach most people. Only after you know how to use the brakes, they teach you how to use the fuel pedal. They accelerate and it’s the same when you learn how to ski. I never learned how to ski, but people who had told me the first thing they tell you is how to how to stop, how to fall. It’s a bad idea to 1st teach you how to kind of, OK. \nSpeaker 1 \nHey, Janice. \nSpeaker 2 \nGo faster and then when you are down the slope they start shouting. OK, this is. How you stop? And this is what we’re doing with AI. Like you have this cause of people in places like Silicon Valley, let’s go as fast as we can if. There is a problem down. The road, we’ll figure it out how to stop. That’s very, very dangerous. \nSpeaker 1 \nYou all before you go, let me ask you one final final question and it’s news. We could all use you are writing this whole book about AI and technology and you do not carry a smartphone. Is this true? \nSpeaker 2 \nI have a kind of, you know, emergency smartphone because for various services, but I don’t carry it with me, it’s like. \nSpeaker 1 \nHow does your whole life work? Because. I’m told you do not carry a phone. You don’t have an e-mail the whole. Thing. \nSpeaker 2 \nNo, I have e-mail. \nSpeaker 1 \nI have e-mail. \nSpeaker 2 \nI don’t have and I try to use technology but not to be used by it. And part of the answer is that they have a team who is carrying the smartphone and doing all that for me. So it’s not so fair to say that I don’t, I don’t have it. But I think on on a on a bigger issue, what we can say it’s it’s a bit like with food. That 100 years ago, food was scarce, so people ate. Whatever they could, and if they found something full of sugar and fat, they ate as much of it as possible because it gave you a lot of energy. And now we are flooded by enormous amounts of food and junk food which is artificially pumped full of fat and sugar and is creating immense health problems. And most people have realized that more food is not always good for me and that I need to have some kind of diet. And it’s exactly the same with information. When the information died, a previously information was scarce, so we consumed whatever we could find. Now we are flooded by enormous amounts of information, and much of it is junk information which is artificially filled with hatred. And greed and fear. And we basically need to grow on an information diet. And consume less information. And be far more mindful about what we put inside that information is the food for the mind. And you know, you feed your mind with unhealthy information. You’ll have sick mind. It’s as simple as that. \nSpeaker 1 \nWell, we want to thank you, ball add Nexus to your information diet because it’s an important document, our future and our world and want to thank you for this fascinating conversation. Thank you. And thank you for your questions. About. \nSpeaker 2 \nThank you."

    "text": "0:00\nwhen camela Harris was Camala Harris was talking about Equity she either didn’t\n0:05\nknow what she was talking about which is inexcusable or she knew what she was talking about which was malevolent those\n0:13\nare the options it’s like they just mean equality of opportunity it’s like then why do they have a different word they\n0:20\ndon’t mean equality of opportunity they mean equality of outcome if you’re foolish enough to believe in equality of\n0:25\noutcome then you deserve to lose the Senate lose the house and lose the\n0:31\npresidency right and that’s what happened that’s\n0:37\nthat American Dream element that that admiration for entrepreneurial\n0:43\nExcellence that while you see that manifested in someone like Elon Musk and you know two thumbs up for that as far\n0:50\nas I’m concerned and it would be lovely especially over the next four years if all you entrepreneurial types stop\n0:56\nletting the radical progressives have the moral upper hand because they for the poor it’s like no they’re not not a\n1:03\nnot even a bit all the bloody green leftists have done in Europe is doomed the poor to extensive and deteriorating\n1:10\npoverty that’s all they’ve done they haven’t cleaned up the environment one bit they would musk jump the board I\n1:16\nthought oh if musk would do something like establish a a department of\n1:21\ngovernmental efficiency I would support Trump just for that like just that but that’s not\n1:27\nall he’s got I think Gabbert is great she’s very very solid she’s the candidate the Democrats should have run\n1:33\nthis is an appalling fact if Biden would have been willing to give Trump some credit which he should have because Mr\n1:39\nTrump might have just ridden off into the sunset If he if they had been willing to give the devil is due you\n1:46\nknow he should have got the Nobel Peace Prize for those Abraham Accords if someone just meet you on an elevator and\n1:51\nsays what do you do how do you\n1:57\nrespond um I off often tell them to look up my name but to beware of doing so\n2:04\nthat’s a good answer that is a really good answer uh so what is the best thing\n2:11\nand the worst thing about being Jordan Peterson well I I suppose the worst\n2:18\nthing probably is that I can’t I’m I’m quite a lot of trouble all things considered um I’m\n2:26\ntroubled to my wife I’m troubled to me I’m troubled to be around and so maybe that’s the worst thing it’s complicated\n2:33\num the best thing is unlimited opportunity right yeah it’s\n2:39\nit’s it’s it’s absurd fundamentally that’s great it’s ridiculous it’s ridiculously great and\n2:46\nwell so I have a question here how do you decide who gets your time what gets your time how and how do you politely\n2:52\nsay no to set boundaries because it’s got to be all these opportunities there’s opportunity cost right with\n2:58\nopportunities so you have to spend that time well there there’s a variety of ways of doing that and you have to build\n3:04\nyou as your wealth of opportunities increases the infrastructure that you have around you to deal with the\n3:11\nopportunities also has to expand and so there’s a variety of ways that you\n3:17\ndecide what gets your time when you have more opportunities than you know what to do with and first thing you have to do\n3:24\nis figure out what your priorities are right so you need a vision for the future that’s welldeveloped and then you\n3:29\nhave to see if the opportunities that you’re being presented with are in keeping with what it is that you’re\n3:35\ntrying to achieve and that should be very well delineated then I have a lot\n3:42\nof people who help me with that you know I’m surrounded I wouldn’t call them Gatekeepers exactly because that’s not\n3:49\nright the right way of conceptualizing them I have a variety of people around me who help me negotiate and who\n3:56\nprioritize potential opportunities for me and there people who know why I’m\n4:01\ndoing what I’m doing and who are on board with that and so when they’re making decisions I can be confident that\n4:07\nthey’re bringing to my attention and prioritizing opportunities that further the broader Mission and then I suppose\n4:17\nthat I also use money because money is the way that we negotiate priority and\n4:23\nso and and it’s a very efficient way of doing that if I have two opportunities that look like they’re of equal value\n4:30\nwith regard to the relevance to my aims and one pays twice as much well it’s obvious which one to take and that’s\n4:37\npartly why we use money right because money is a universal representation system for value and it can’t it’s not\n4:45\nperfect because it doesn’t fully capture potential opportunity right it’s\n4:51\nlike when you’re trying to value a company you can value the company with regards to its current earnings or its\n4:56\nprofit margin but you also have to factor in growth and that’s a difficult thing to do and so if I’m trying to\n5:02\nprioritize opportunities the financial return is obviously relevant but the\n5:08\npossibility for growth coming out of the opportunity is also now that’s more\n5:13\ndifficult to quantify but that’s also why I have lots of people around me who help me with that and like I have lots of people around me who who do this for\n5:20\nme there’s probably altogether All Things Considered there’s at least 15\n5:26\npeople uh there’s probably more like 30 who are doing this for me all the time\n5:31\nand so all the opportunities that do end up on my desk so to speak have been vetted extraordinarily thoroughly and\n5:38\nthey’re almost inevitably worth further Pursuit but\n5:46\nso if you’re overwhelmed by your responsibilities and your opportunities\n5:52\npart of the reason for that is that you haven’t distributed enough responsibility to other people you\n5:58\nhaven’t set up a team that’s of sufficient quality and then you have to\n6:04\nask yourself why you know one possible reason might be that you’re\n6:10\nnot brutal enough to make the hard decisions that are necessary with\n6:16\nregards to Staffing so for example I’ve been running a tour now\n6:23\nfor8 years I guess 8 years and we’re\n6:28\nvery cutting dried with regards to our touring Staffing we have very stringent\n6:34\nrules and the one rule for example is don’t bother the people who come and see\n6:40\nme you are obligated to be 100% polite\n6:46\nto them under all circumstances all the time and that goes as well for I travel\n6:52\nwith some security guys for example and they help me with Logistics and like they have to be good to the waiters and\n6:58\nto all the service staff that we encounter like I want to travel to the places I’m going leaving nothing but a\n7:05\ngood taste behind and this is something very important to consider if you’re running any kind kind of business\n7:11\nespecially as you become more successful because if people have a certain degree\n7:16\nof admiration for you let’s say or you’re even willing to meet you halfway and then you disappoint them they will\n7:23\nnever forget that and they will tell like a thousand people and you don’t have to make many mistakes like that\n7:29\ntill gets around and things are not good and so our policy especially on the\n7:34\ntours is you don’t make mistakes if you make mistakes we you don’t come along\n7:39\nand now I shouldn’t exactly say that because people are going to make mistakes they have to fix them right I\n7:46\nmean things are going to slip a sideways from time to time but you have to fix it\n7:51\nand and you you have to treat everyone well and that’s our criteria for that\n7:57\nare very strict and stringent and that’s the case for all the Staffing and hiring decisions that we make and because of\n8:05\nthat I I’m surrounded by people that I can really trust and they have their things to do and I leave them alone so\n8:12\nthat’s another thing you know if you if you’re overwhelmed with responsibility and opportunity you got to ask yourself\n8:17\nif you’re trying to control too much and you might think well I want to pay every\n8:22\nattention to every little detail it’s like no you don’t no you don’t you want\n8:28\nto use your time which is rare so that you focus on\n8:34\nthose things that only you can do and that you do best and everything else\n8:39\nthat anyone else could do that should be distributed down to them and so and you\n8:44\ncan do that if you’re willing to be picky in your hiring and your and your\n8:51\nuh what would you say your willingness to maintain people over the long run if\n8:57\nyou’re picky in that about that then you can just distribute responsibility and the huge advantage to that is then you\n9:02\nget to focus on what you’re best at and what you find that’s most compelling and you get get to further your aims and\n9:09\nthere’s no loss in that and it also stops you from getting worn out and it stops you from getting resentful and you\n9:15\ndon’t want to get worn out because then you do stupid things and you die and you don’t want to get resentful because then\n9:21\nyou’re miserable to yourself and everyone else and so you you maximize the opportunity\n9:28\nthat’s in front of You by building an efficient infrastructure and then you shouldn’t be overworked you know you got\n9:34\nto also ask yourself if you’re overworked if that’s a reflection of egotism you know because you might there\n9:40\nmight be part of you that’s thinking well you know only I can do this it’s like there are probably some things that you’re doing that only you can do but\n9:48\nyou have to be able to maintain that sustain it across time but as I said even more\n9:53\nimportantly the probability that you’re the only person that can do absolutely everything you’re doing is very low\n10:00\nthere may be some things that you’re particularly good at you should obviously be doing almost nothing but that so on the tours for example I don’t\n10:07\ndo anything but show up I show like there’s a rule I’m to be there an hour before come hell or high water and ready\n10:15\nso I have to have a rest beforehand I don’t pay attention to flights I don’t pay attention to hotels I don’t pay\n10:20\nattention to restaurants or any any details whatsoever I have people that I\n10:27\nfollow when I’m walking through airports like all I’m doing is focusing on the tour and I suppose a subsidiary concern\n10:34\nthere is my wife because she travels with me and we have to set up the tour so that she’s also thrilled to be along\n10:42\nand thrilled matters because we’ve been trying to make this which is probably the most intense thing that I do we’ve\n10:48\nbeen trying to make this sustainable and to make it sustainable you have to not be upset\n10:53\nabout it cuz otherwise you’ll just you’ll stop doing it and so well\n11:03\nwell you handle more responsibility and Opportunity by building a more differentiated sub substructure under\n11:10\nyou and that’s the other thing that’s cool about that is there’s no limit to what you can do then right because you just keep building layers of\n11:17\ninfrastructure beneath you and if you hire properly and you’re very careful about that then you can just keep\n11:23\njumping up the ladder so to speak that’s how you’re that’s how you work neurologically by the way way when you\n11:30\npay attention to something and you practice it you build little automated structures that are neurological and\n11:35\nthen they run unconsciously and then your Consciousness jumps up a letter a level so that you can concentrate on\n11:41\nthings that haven’t yet been automatized so you’re trying to put in routines all the time underneath you so that you can\n11:47\nfree yourself up to attend to only those things that are crucial you know that if you study people too like Steve Jobs and\n11:54\nElon Musk I mean jobs in particular was absolutely I know people who’ worked with him very closely as well as musk\n12:02\njobs was unbelievably good at deciding what he wasn’t going to do right he put all his attention on the things where\n12:08\nthe maximum return would be this is something to know too even technically so you know you’ve heard about the 8020\n12:14\nrule I presumes 20% of your customers provide 80% of your business that’s not\n12:19\nthe rule the rule is way more remarkable than that so here’s the\n12:28\nrule among the people that work for you the square root of the number of people that you that work for you do half the\n12:36\nwork so that means if you have 10 employees three of them do half the work but if you have 10,000 employees a\n12:43\nhundred of them do half the work now this is an unbelievably well\n12:48\ndocumented phenomenon I’m not telling you something that’s in the realm of speculation this is a this is a solid\n12:53\nstatistical law now there’s a rule that goes along with it this and this is very\n12:58\ndifficult for managerial people to understand because they almost always do exactly the opposite spend all your time\n13:04\nwith your most productive people now the typical manager does exactly the opposite they find the 10% of their\n13:11\nstaff that are floundering and spend all their time with them I can understand why you do that\n13:17\nfrom the perspective of let’s say sympathy although it’s counterproductive you’re not going to help them you don’t\n13:23\nhave the ability you don’t have the time they don’t have the motivation it’s not going to work you spend all it’s not\n13:30\ngoing to work you can’t do it you spend all your time with your most productive people and the same with your own use of\n13:36\ntime is you spend all your time on those things that are that you are best suited to do and you have to be brutal about\n13:43\nthat and there’s nothing in that that’s anything but good because you end up\n13:49\ndoing the maximum amount of good that you can in the most sustainable way and you provide the largest possible number\n13:54\nof people with the greatest opportunity like there’s nothing in that that’s anything but good\n14:00\nand the people who are floundering you know I had a hard time in my lab when I was a\n14:06\nprofessor letting people go when I should have and I learned to do that\n14:12\nquite painfully I would say one of the things I realized and this is something to really get in your head too if you\n14:18\ncan especially if you’re a little more on the agreeable side you don’t like hurting people’s feelings enabling someone’s failure is\n14:25\nnot a moral accomplishment and so if you have someone who’s either outright\n14:30\nfailing or or Worse kind of drifting along so they’re not you know performing\n14:36\npoorly enough to really come to your attention but they’re really not all in it’s like there’s no reason not to sit\n14:43\ndown with them and say like you know you’re not thriving so what the hell are you doing\n14:50\nyou want to drag your Sor carcus through this job doing a second you know hitting\n14:56\nthis in the second rate manner for the next 15 years as you age painfully or do you want to go out and see if you can\n15:03\nfind something you could commit yourself to like this is not a game and so\n15:08\nthere’s some pain in letting people go but there’s pain in M There’s real pain\n15:14\nin maintaining people in a quasi failure situation and so it’s better just to say\n15:21\nwhy don’t you go find something you want to do and you know people don’t like change\n15:27\nand they might be all upset about the fact that that didn’t work but you lying about the fact that it’s working isn’t\n15:33\nhelping them and then you could put someone in that position who’s like pretty thrilled\n15:39\nto be there and is they’re going to devote themselves\n15:44\ncompletely to it and then you know God only knows how good that’s going to be for them and the people around them the\n15:49\nother thing other problem with having people around or doing a second rate job is that they’re really hard on the\n15:55\npeople that work for them you know they don’t know to distribute reward properly they’re\n16:00\njealous of anybody who’s working effectively they’re going to push down anyone that they see to be a threat\n16:07\nthey’re going to you know hoard information no you you just describe the\n16:12\ntypical day of most entrepreneurs yeah hey the management side is a tough one\n16:18\nyou know it’s a tough one and it’s hard to wrap your head around the balance\n16:23\nbetween separating the wheat from the chaff let’s say and being sympathetic and kind but sympathetic and kind in the\n16:31\nmoment is not a good medium to long-term strategy it’s kind of the difference on a trait level it’s the difference\n16:37\nbetween being agreeable agreeable people avoid conflict and you can understand that and\n16:44\nthey default towards sympathy and and mercy let’s say um conscientious people\n16:50\nlook at performance and agreeableness isn’t a bad ethic for within a family\n16:56\nbut conscientiousness is the ethic that works on large scale Enterprises and conscientiousness is pretty\n17:01\nstraightforward it’s like can you do the job or not and if the answer is no well then\n17:07\nyou should find a different job you know or retool your attitude that’s unlikely\n17:13\nby the way and you know the probability that you as a manager is going to are\n17:18\ngoing to get someone to shift their attitude at a fundamental level it’s pretty low like especially if they’re\n17:24\nreally in a failure pattern because you don’t even know what the hell’s going on with them and so better to pay pay\n17:31\nbetter to spend your time with your high performing people it’s a very hard thing to learn and it’s it’s cruel in a way\n17:38\nyou know it has that El element of Cruelty but not in the long run you know\n17:44\nI I have an idea though like so I’ve got you know you your first book was maps of meaning then you got 12 rules for life\n17:50\nand then beyond order but if you wanted to do a spoof book and do the complete opposite of everything he just said and\n17:55\nthen have Beyond chaos I think it would yeah bad idea bad idea yeah well I\n18:01\nthought I’ve thought about writing a book on how to fail right no I think it would be pretty funny yeah well there’s lots of ways yeah yeah yeah well what’s\n18:09\nhis name Robert Green he’s kind of done that he’s done that in some ways by laying out the P he’s laid it laid out\n18:15\nin in his books he’s laid out what would you say a description of psychopathy you\n18:20\nknow and that’s useful to know because there are psychopaths in the world and you need to know how to handle them\n18:25\nwithout becoming one right which is a difficult thing like contagious where you can become a\n18:34\npsychopath yes it’s well it is contagious I mean one of the things we do know for example is that the worst\n18:40\nthing you can do with people who have an antisocial proclivity is to group them together so there’s a famous study done\n18:46\nin 19 1930s in a in a town called Somerville in Massachusetts um was one\n18:53\nof the first large-scale epidemiological studies designed to remediate antisocial behavior and would be Behavior that’s\n18:59\nassociated with criminality and children who have a criminal bent their diagnosis\n19:05\nis childhood conduct disorder and so you can identify precursors to criminal behavior in children early sexual U\n19:13\nexperience for example is a marker just so you know um they the Somerville crowd did an\n19:20\nintervention with with inner city kids in the 1930s designed to Sidetrack kids\n19:26\nwho were at risk for later criminal Behavior so from broken families for example in lower socioeconomic in lower\n19:34\nsocioeconomic neighborhood and they basically threw the works at them in terms of interventions and uh divided\n19:41\nthem randomly into an intervention group and a non-intervention group was actually a well-designed study and uh\n19:48\nyou know they taught them to read they taught them social skills they taught their parents parenting skills they did everything you could possibly imagine\n19:54\nthat might help remediate this developmental\n20:00\ntrajectory towards criminality one of the things they did was they took the kids out of the uh Urban environments\n20:06\nand put them in camps in summer camps for two weeks a year and the kids loved it and the counselors loved it and\n20:12\neverybody thought this the whole program was great and then they de blinded the study and analyzed the results and the\n20:18\nkids in the intervention group did far worse much more likely to be alcoholic much more likely to be criminal much\n20:24\nmore likely to suffer from severe illnesses like schizophrenia and when they did the detailed an is they found\n20:29\nthat the reason for that was that they grouped them together in summer camps and they learned to compete to be\n20:35\ncriminal right and so one of the things we know this is one of the real failures of the prison system is there isn’t\n20:40\nanything worse you can do for antisocial people than can to put them with other antisocial people because then they’re\n20:46\naround antisocial experts and they compete right well it makes sense right\n20:52\nwell that we also found too that uh so the Psychopaths not all criminals are psychopaths by the way it’s a minority\n21:00\nof criminals who are psychopaths but if you put psychopaths in group therapy it makes them worse why well they get\n21:07\nbetter at doing what they do like they’re already manipulators that’s pretty much how they operate like if if\n21:13\nI’m a psychopath and I’m talking to you the only thing I’m concerned is is with\n21:19\nwhat you can deliver like that’s it you’re just a landscape of opportunity and if you\n21:25\nhappen to be kind and sympathetic so much the better right so if you put\n21:30\nPsychopaths through group therapy they get more effective doesn’t remediate the\n21:36\npsychopathy at all it’s also very very difficult to change that very very difficult it’s very very stable from\n21:43\nlike age four onward gotcha so yes you can teach people to be more criminal and more Psychopathic and we do that quite\n21:49\neffectively in our society by the way we handle them wow so yeah it’s bad so you\n21:54\nyou’ve uh you’ve had Chris Voss who’s sitting here uh front row on your uh on\n21:59\nyour podcast before so I I yeah and I was just wondered if if you were to\n22:05\ncategorize him as a narcissist sociopath or psychopath how how do you think he would rate well fortunately I don’t have\n22:13\nto answer that question you know you know what you are\n22:18\nso good at debates and making your case and backing it up with you know not only\n22:25\nyour own view but stats I mean you have this incredible ability ability to Resource you know so much um how does\n22:32\none develop that skill uh I don’t know if everyone can because you can to a\n22:38\ngreater or lesser degree I mean um it’s helpful to have the innate ability let’s\n22:45\nsay so one of the things people differ in for example is a trait called verbal fluency It’s associated with\n22:51\nextraversion and sociability and positive Emotion by the way but verbal\n22:57\nfluency is the r at which you can think up words and there’s massive variation\n23:02\nin that so for example if I had all of you you can test it very easily so imagine I had all you people write down\n23:09\nas many words as you could that begin with the letter s in 3 minutes okay some\n23:14\nof you would produce like 30 words and some of you would produce 150 like it’s a huge variation and it’s It’s\n23:21\nassociated with verbal intelligence which is in turn associated with General cognitive ability but there are other\n23:27\nelements of intelligence that aren’t verbal so you can have lower verbal fluency and and be very good at spatial\n23:35\nintelligence for example or manipulating images but High verbal fluency is very\n23:40\nuseful with with regards to a career as a debater or public speaker and I mean I\n23:46\ndon’t know if you know who Camille pelia is but she’s off the charts and verbal fluency Ben Shapiro he’s another like\n23:52\nmachine gun speaker Russell Brand those are the people I’ve met in my life who are the most verbally fluent and that’s\n23:58\nhuge part of that’s an innate skill in terms of developing your ability to speak I would say well there’s a variety\n24:07\nof things that you can learn to do I don’t debate to win I’m not\n24:13\nparticularly interested in winning I stopped doing that when I was in my 20s when I learned that that was a\n24:18\ncounterproductive strategy what I’m trying to do when I speak is to say what\n24:24\nI believe to be true and that’s a long-term vict iory like the truth is a\n24:30\nlong-term strategy right and it’s the opposite of manipulation and so all I’m\n24:35\ntrying to do is to formulate my words as clearly as I possibly can and some of that’s an embodied sense like if you you\n24:42\ncan learn to you can learn to do this it’s really worth learning although it’s very unsettling when you start you you\n24:50\nwant to feel out whether or not the words that you’re saying are like firm\n24:58\nimagine you’re qu crossing a swampy plane and you can’t see into the water\n25:03\nyou know there’s a trail and underneath the water 6 in or so there are well set\n25:10\nFoundation stones and you can sort of feel them out as you make your way that’s how Moses went across the Red Sea\n25:16\nyou know the Sea of chaos is you can tell when you’re speaking if you pay attention what words you’re saying make\n25:23\nyou confident and that’s a way of telling that there’s firm ground under your feet and it’s the opposite of being\n25:30\nself-conscious you know if you start speaking publicly and you become self-conscious it’s because you’ve\n25:35\nbecome concerned with how people are responding to you well it’s not about\n25:41\nyou it’s not about you it’s about the validity of your words and if you’re\n25:46\nfocusing on what it is that you have to say and you find the firm words you’ll\n25:52\nbe a compelling public speaker and that’s the case too even if you’re not particularly verbally fluent because\n25:57\npeople will be to tell that what you’re doing is wrestling with the ideas at\n26:03\nhand and trying to find your way forward and everyone wants to see that that’s a\n26:09\nthat’s a kind of Highwire performance and so and that that’s way different than wanting victory like Victory\n26:17\nthere’s lots of different kinds of Victory you know there’s the egotistical victory of the moment and there’s the\n26:23\nsetting the foundations for Success across the broadest possible SP of time\n26:28\nand place into the future and the truth is a way better long-term strategy like\n26:35\nyou might pay for it in the present which is why people lie obviously but so you want to find the right words now so\n26:42\nyou you can learn to do that you got to listen to yourself talk and you got to think well do I actually believe that or\n26:48\nam I trying to impress this person or am I trying to close the business deal you know is there am I manipulating the\n26:55\nsituation so that I get what I want rather than merely trying to represent\n27:00\nthe truth now you might say well why shouldn’t you get what you want and the answer is well what the hell do you know\n27:06\nI mean how often have you been wrong about what you want lots I presume and\n27:12\nhow often have you got something what that you wanted maybe by the by a route\n27:17\nthat wasn’t the straightest let’s say and found out that that didn’t you do you any good at all it’s much better\n27:23\njust to say what you believe to be the case and that also helps you build a foundation for speaking into the future\n27:31\nit also allows you to draw on your own experience you know like there isn’t anyone who\n27:37\ncan’t comport themselves in a manner that’s interesting one of the things I learned as a clinician was that and I\n27:44\nhad a very wide variety of clients ranging from people who were just barely clinging to the edge of the Earth by\n27:50\ntheir fingernails to people who were extremely accomplished on multiple\n27:56\nDimensions you know and even the simpler people even the cognitively impaired\n28:01\npeople that I dealt with who ver who had in some cases virtually nothing going for them if I could listen hard enough\n28:09\nand get them to talk about what they knew they were immediately compelling and interesting and they had things to\n28:15\nsay and I had things to learn from them and so you can be a compelling public\n28:20\nspeaker if you actually talk about the things that you know to be true right\n28:26\nbut that means you have to forgo the the ego games that are associated it’s the same in a in a debate you\n28:34\nknow it’s a victory if you clarify your thoughts in the course of a discussion\n28:40\nthat’s a victory that’s sort of independent of the perceived victory of the moment\n28:47\nlet’s say right yeah now the other thing you can do on the public speaking side is you watch watch your speech and you\n28:55\nshould eliminate ums and likes and all those filler words that people use that\n29:03\nhas to go it it makes you inarticulate and you can learn to control that and instead of filling the pause with an um\n29:10\nor a like or a you know you can just be silent like there’s nothing wrong with\n29:16\ntaking a pause and collecting your thoughts and you want to have your goal in mind like when I go on stage when I’m\n29:23\ndoing my lectures when I’m touring I always have a question in mind mind right and that’s a priority it’s\n29:30\nlike okay what am I talking about tonight here’s the question and what does the talk consist of it talk it\n29:36\nconsists of an attempt to not only answer that question but to push the\n29:42\nanswer to the question farther than I’ve been able to push it before and that\n29:47\nadds some novelty to it and then the the talk becomes an exploration with the audience and that’s way more interesting\n29:54\nfor everyone you know you the last thing you want to do is is like read if you\n29:59\ncan avoid that don’t do that don’t do that no matter how good your re your\n30:05\npresentation is you’re going to lose most of the audience if you read it best\n30:10\nto have if you’re going to use PowerPoint use images or just a couple of phrases and you can read the phrase\n30:16\nand then discuss it you know but people want to see you actively engaging in the ideas they don’t want to hear some\n30:22\ncanned and stereotyped set of responses and you’re not there to plead the\n30:28\naudience you know they there to figure out something with everyone and what else can you do when you’re in front of\n30:34\na crowd you’re going to be afraid of the crowd but you shouldn’t be talking to the crowd there’s no crowd you can talk\n30:42\nto an individual everyone so what you do and you pick out people in the group and you talk to them you know and you look\n30:48\nat them and when you walk on stage you look everywhere so that you’re not afraid of what’s in front of you and\n30:54\nthen you just talk and you always pick people out and look at them and see if\n30:59\nthey’re paying attention and if they’re not well you got to play with the audience\n31:04\nyou know and so what is it get rid of the filler words get rid of the idea that you’re there to accomplish your\n31:11\ngoal your narrow goal try to say what’s true see if you can find your way find\n31:17\nthe words that make you feel solid it’s the opposite of self-consciousness play a bit explore\n31:24\nhave a question firmly in mind you know and risks some failure too that’s that’s\n31:29\nfun you go out on stage like I never know when I go on stage for a talk I never know if it’s going to work and\n31:36\nneither does the audience and so they’re all part of what grips them is the fact that I could just miss the mark you know\n31:44\nthat it could go nowhere and that’s a real challenge to see if you can put\n31:50\ntogether new ideas on the Fly and address the issue at hand and to bring everyone along for the ride and that’s\n31:58\nthere’s no failure if you do that even if it doesn’t work out that well like at least it’s a noble attempt that went\n32:03\nsomewhat sideways that’s something and then people get to know who you are too and so do you and that’s a good\n32:11\ndeal can be a good deal so well so to that that point to get to know who you\n32:16\nare so you have put yourself many times in positions having discussions or\n32:22\ndebates or interviews with people that you know dislike you you know they’re going to try to challenge you uh are you\n32:31\ndoing that uh I’d love to have you break down to to reach people that you feel\n32:38\nneed to be educated on a different way of thinking about it are you doing it to\n32:43\nhelp yourself get better at thinking through these difficult sort of challenges I don’t I don’t set\n32:51\nout precisely to put myself in situations like that it’s more like they\n32:57\narrive you know I’ve done a lot of interviews and some of them have been with people\n33:04\nwho are genuine interlocutors and others are\n33:10\npeople who want to play a game and so I give people the benefit of\n33:16\nthe doubt so if I meet someone I assume that we’re playing a straight game and then I watch them and if they’re playing\n33:24\na straight game then then I treat them politely and if\n33:32\nthey’re not playing a straight game I think okay what the hell are you up to and the\n33:39\nproblem is for them generally is I was a clinician for a long time and tricky\n33:45\njournalists think they’re tricky and they’re nowhere near as tricky as the people that I’ve dealt with they’re not\n33:51\neven in the same universe and so I’m serious and so if I think okay you’re\n33:57\nnot playing a straight game I see so now we’re playing clinician are we and so\n34:03\nthen I can usually figure out what the person’s up to and that’s usually not very good for them so and I don’t like\n34:10\ndoing that you know like when I meet someone socially I’m not bringing my clinical eye to bear\n34:18\nit’s the polite thing to do and the appropriate thing to do socially is to assume Goodwill and meet people there\n34:25\nand if you’re not naive that that’s a form of courage you know cuz I could be very skeptical when I meet people but\n34:32\nI’m not I think probably you’re playing a straight game at at least mostly or and good then we’ll go we’ll proceed on\n34:39\nthat basis but if that’s not the situation then I’m also prepared to play\n34:46\nthat game and so that’s worked spectacularly well upon occasion yeah\n34:53\nand it was it was often with journalists who they weren’t there to play a straight game at all and they were one\n34:59\nof them confessed in fact a woman named Nelly bus who she got me probably more\n35:04\nthan anyone else did because she was she was very very devious very very devious\n35:10\nand she fooled me into thinking she was someone other than who she was and she\n35:16\nadmitted several years later that her role at the New York Times was to seduce\n35:21\nessentially the people that she was interviewing and then continued to talk to them until\n35:28\nthey said something that she could twist into reputation destruction and Elevate\n35:34\nher status in consequence she said lots of the New York Times reporters are playing that game and that’s\n35:42\na that’s a pretty uh that’s a psychopathic game and she\n35:48\nwas particularly good at it now she did admit it and apologize\n35:54\nbut those things aren’t easy to change once you practice system and so you know maybe she learned her lesson and maybe\n36:00\nshe didn’t so so I don’t look for trouble you know\n36:06\num well I don’t I don’t look for trouble and I’ve avoided universities mostly\n36:12\nsince about 2018 because they just got way too annoying I don’t know why anybody ever goes and speaks a\n36:18\nuniversity they’re a pain in the neck they don’t pay anything they’re they\n36:23\nthink that it’s a privilege for you to speak there and sometimes it is you know that there is occasions where that’s the\n36:29\ncase but mostly it’s just it’s just not worth the trouble yeah and so I don’t I\n36:36\ndo that rarely you know and still now and then but rarely um in terms of\n36:41\ninterviews mostly what we’ve changed as a family is I I won’t do an interview without recording it and so often now if\n36:49\nI run into someone who’s playing games we just release the whole recording and that usually does the\n36:55\ntrick because I you know I I I’m not concerned about revealing what\n37:04\nit is that I’ve said and like you you may know that the Ontario College of psychologists and behavior an\n37:11\nanalysts um they changed their name how convenient for them um they’re trying to\n37:17\ntake away my license you know and right now we’re negotiating because I’m supposed to be re-educated which you\n37:24\nknow isn’t really going to work that well and\n37:29\nyou know I told them that I would do their re-education but there’s no bloody way they’re going to be able to do it in\n37:34\nsecret and they told me two weeks ago that they would proceed with the\n37:40\nre-education because they found someone who apparently is willing to do this but they told me that I couldn’t record it\n37:47\nthat they’d have a court recorder there to make a transcript but that I couldn’t have the transcript if I didn’t agree to\n37:53\nkeep it secret and now the reason that those processes procedures are usually\n37:58\nsecret is to protect the person who’s being disciplined let’s say not the people who are doing the discipline and\n38:05\nso I said well no I’m not doing that I’m going to make every bloody second of this 100% public clearly obviously\n38:15\nyou’re not doing this behind closed doors so well that was the last letter we sent back to them I don’t know what\n38:21\nthe hell they’re going to do about that but but there’s there isn’t a hope in hell that they’re going to be able to\n38:26\nstop me from recording this like not unless they’re willing to do a cavity\n38:32\nsearch so seriously like this is not happening in secret I’ve got would I say\n38:38\nI have nothing to hide you know everyone has something to hide let’s make no you\n38:44\nknow mistakes about that but there’s certainly nothing that I could possibly say in the course of a\n38:50\nre-education episode whatever the hell that would be that I wouldn’t be 100% willing to make public and that’s also\n38:56\npart and parcel of of this the consequence of this finding my words carefully you know it’s like I’m not\n39:03\nsaying things I don’t mean and then you might say well what do you mean that you mean something it’s\n39:10\nlike if I say something if I say no for example and I’ve said no I’ve said no to\n39:17\ngovernment legislation in Canada what no means is there isn’t anything you can do\n39:23\nto me that would force me to comply with your request T and I’ve thought it\n39:30\nthrough and so I did a lot of negotiating counseling with my clients\n39:35\nyou know I I know what no means I know how rarely you use it you use it when you mean it and to mean it means you\n39:42\nhave to think it through and if if you want to stop someone from having the upper hand over\n39:50\nyou you just have to give up everything they want you have to think that through it’s like okay you’re going to take my\n39:56\nlicense can I live with that well then I have to have a plan if that happens what\n40:01\nam I going to do you know if I’m all panicked about that well then I lose but\n40:06\nif I’ve Got a Way Forward it’s like okay do your worst and so well then what you know if\n40:13\nyou take away the upper hand you’re free and all you have to do to take away the\n40:19\nupper hand is to give up what’s being requested and now that you may have to think that through\n40:25\nbut they might take it anyways even if you don’t think it through so you might as well think it through and you know\n40:32\nyou may also find that unbeknownst to you there’s tremendous opportunity in\n40:37\nthat sacrifice you know like with the college for example with the psychologist it’s like not obvious to me that I want to be\n40:44\npart of their damn Club anymore because they become unbelievably corrupt like the medical establishments the medical\n40:51\nassociations you know I’m not going to let them take my license because I’m not going to let a pack of faceless bureaucrats take something me without\n40:58\nmaking their life hell but that doesn’t mean that I’m happy to be part of their\n41:03\nlittle codery so but I’ve already I can live without my license I’ve got lots of I’m\n41:11\nnot out of options not by any stretch of the imagination so yeah that’s for sure\n41:19\nuh so you did this I thought fascinating video where you analyzed Elon Musk tulsy\n41:26\nGabbert and uh JD Vance and uh Bobby Kennedy and Trump right and so in so I\n41:34\nhad a zoom with you uh the day before the elections and Trump has won uh and\n41:40\nnow we have all these people that are losing their minds that have Trump\n41:46\nderangement syndrome but there’s people that have Jordan Peterson derangement syndrome or Bobby Kennedy derangement\n41:51\nsyndrome or tucko Carlson derangement syndrome uh what do you first first off love to\n41:57\nget your thoughts on where we’re at now you and you can’t vote CU you’re a Canadian so but you have a tremendous\n42:03\namount of insight on politics and you’re you’re doing stuff well I could talk about the Democrats you know I worked\n42:10\nwith the Democrats behind the scenes for like six years a long time and and quite a lot um\n42:20\na friend of mine who I worked with who was very well connected with the DNC and\n42:27\nthe Democrat hierarchy nationally he’s one of their main political strategists\n42:33\nhe just so you all know this is something perhaps you would like to know in\n42:39\n2017 I made an offer to the\n42:45\nDemocratic party Elite me and Rogan and Dave Rubin and Brett Weinstein and Ben\n42:52\nShapiro we invited them all to come on our podcast it was an open Ed offer we\n42:57\nhave it in writing my friend his name is Greg herwitz released this the other day on Twitter because all the Democrats and\n43:04\nthe Legacy Media types are squawking up and down about the fact that the conservatives have you know created this\n43:10\nNew non-legacy Media space and are dominating it and how unfair that is it’s like you sons of we asked\n43:17\nyou for seven years 7 years to come and\n43:22\ntalk to us and he Greg got nowhere he couldn’t find one now I eventually\n43:27\ntalked to Dean Phillips who had run for president on the Democrat side if you may remember Dean because he dropped out\n43:34\nfairly early in the presidential race and he was willing to talk to me because he just got Savaged by the Democrat\n43:41\nParty structure when he dared to put his foot forward as a genuine Contender on the Democrat side so I did get to speak\n43:48\nto the odd Democrat who got bitten so hard by the radical leftists that they\n43:53\nwell that they were that they were willing to share their experience let’s say um why am I bringing that up well\n44:02\none of the things that we’re going to have to wrestle with going forward is you know the country is very disunited\n44:08\nand it isn’t useful that half the population let’s say the rough half that\n44:13\nvoted for camela Harris are living in Terror of the Trump mob first of all\n44:18\nbecause I don’t think that’s necessary and second Trump’s going to have to work with those people in many ways anyways\n44:25\nand generating a bunch of of additional enmity isn’t going to be helpful like the Democrats are going to have to wake\n44:31\nup to the danger of the radical leftists and they’re so asleep on that front that it’s a kind of bloody Miracle you know\n44:38\neven when I interviewed Mr Kennedy first that was a year ago when he just was starting his\n44:45\npresidential campaign I asked him a question that I’ve asked all the Democrats that I’ve had private\n44:50\nconversations with because these people will speak with me privately but not on the podcast I said when does the left go\n44:57\ntoo far none of them by the way I never got an answer from any of the Centrist\n45:02\nDemocrats to that question which is really quite appalling and Kennedy said I don’t want to run\n45:09\nthat kind of divisive campaign and I thought well you know fair enough but that’s not a very good answer because\n45:15\nthere’s real problems on the radical side of the Democrat political Spectrum as there are there are commensurate\n45:22\nproblems although they’re not as profound yet on the right-wing side\n45:27\nbecause there’s no shortage of derisive Anonymous gleeful\n45:33\nright-wing anti-semitic trolls online and there’s plenty of them and they’re noisy as hell and they’re not good but\n45:40\nthey don’t have the institutional power that the progressives have especially in the universities they’re just completely\n45:46\nblind to the danger of the Progressive Movement and they won’t we’ve been talking to the\n45:52\nDemocrats for seven years like the message was very clear the radical are\n45:57\ngoing to do you in and their answer was they don’t mean what they say it’s like\n46:02\nhave it your way they mean it when camela Harris was Camala Harris was talking about Equity she either didn’t\n46:10\nknow what she was talking about which is inexcusable or she knew what she was talking about which was malevolent those\n46:17\nare the options it’s like they just mean equality of opportunity it’s like then why do they have a different word they\n46:25\ndon’t mean equality of opportunity they mean equality of outcome\n46:30\nand if you’re foolish enough to believe in equality of outcome then you deserve to lose the Senate lose the house and\n46:37\nlose the presidency\n46:42\nright and that’s what happened yeah you know and I think I was talking\n46:49\nto herwitz today and he said that he believed that the swing issue was the\n46:54\ntrans issue that was enough to swing the vote and rightly so because what’s\n47:00\nhappening with regards to this surgical sterilization and mutilation of children is I have never seen any worse form of\n47:09\nmedical and psychological malpractice in not only in my life as an observer of\n47:14\nthe psychological and medical community but in my studies of serious\n47:20\nPsychopathology it is brutal and unacceptable beyond belief and it’s part\n47:26\nof the ID ology that the Democrats wouldn’t the moderate Democrats would not recognize and\n47:32\nso they’ve got a fair bit of mopping up to do and I hope they manage it because it would be good for a trump\n47:39\nAdministration especially one that’s got the reins of power the way that Trump now does to have an effective opposition\n47:46\nyou always need an effective opposition now you need an effective opposition within the confines of your own family\n47:52\nyou know so hopefully they’ll\n47:58\ndo a little soul searching and decide that postmodern communism is not the\n48:05\nright way forward so we’ll\n48:12\nsee what what what advice would you give to someone that is in their mind they\n48:18\nbelieve Trump is a rapist Trump is a racist Trump is this horrible human he\n48:23\ndoesn’t care about people and he’s also the president of the well the first thing you could probably do is stop\n48:29\nwatching CNN and MSNBC it’s like seriously you know I’ve been watching in\n48:34\nthe last week it’s been unbelievably interesting from my perspective personal perspective even to watch the Legacy\n48:40\nMedia finally wake up and realize that it’s not 2005 you know 6 months ago 7\n48:47\nmonths ago I read a an account of Gavin Nome opining about Joe Rogan and me he\n48:53\nsaid that his own son was watching Rogan and me and other Fringe figures and I\n48:59\nthought I don’t know what planet you occupy Mr Nome but Joe Rogan is the most powerful journalist who’s ever lived by\n49:06\nan order of magnitude you know CNN is The Fringe MSNBC is The Fringe Gavin\n49:12\nNewsome is The Fringe Joe Rogan is he runs the most popular podcast in 92\n49:19\ncountries it’s like that’s not Fringe and so\n49:27\nif you are suffering from Trump derangement syndrome I would say you could watch the podcast he did\n49:34\nwith Rogan and with Theo vaugh and you could see what he was actually like when he wasn’t completely on the defensive\n49:42\nfrom being attacked like no other politician in living memory has ever been attacked and the but more\n49:49\nimportantly than that even independently of trump himself and I actually think that all the torture that he’s gone\n49:55\nthrough in the last 8 years years has mellowed them out to some genuine degree even if you’re frightened of trump it’s\n50:02\nlike oh so you’re also frightened of Kennedy who was a Democrat and you’re frightened of Tulsi gabard who was a\n50:08\nDemocrat and you’re frightened of VI ramaswami and um Vance who in a normal\n50:15\nworld would be a Democrat and Trump himself who’s pretty weird Republican it’s like it’s not like well seriously\n50:23\nTrump as a republican what a crazy world we live and so Trump has gathered these\n50:29\npeople around him and he’s invited them in and accepted them and they’re a very strange crew and even if Trump has his\n50:36\nrough edges which he genuinely does it’s like well he’s not alone there now and so that’s a really good deal like my\n50:43\nsense was especially when musk jumped aboard I thought oh if musk would do\n50:49\nsomething like establish a a department of governmental efficiency I would support Trump just\n50:55\nfor that like just just that but that’s not all he’s got I think Gabbert is great she’s very very solid she’s the\n51:02\ncandidate the Democrats should have run She’s Everything CA Harris claimed to be it’s like why the hell didn’t they run\n51:07\nher they could have you know maybe it’s because she had her own thoughts I mean\n51:13\nwho knows well\n51:19\nsir so you know well and then the other thing I’d say about Trump and this is even more important than the team which\n51:25\nis really relevant but more importantly the best predictor of someone’s future behavior is their past Behavior so if\n51:32\nyou’re hiring someone you should look at their General cognitive ability you should look at their temperament but if\n51:38\nyou have a track record that’s quantifiable of their performance in\n51:44\nthat position and it’s positive it’s like there you go that’s the best evidence that you\n51:50\nhave technically and I don’t know if everyone forgot but Trump was President\n51:55\nfor four years and he wasn’t Hitler in\n52:01\nfact zero Wars zero Wars is not many\n52:06\nwars right and more than that more than that zero Wars that’s not nothing that’s\n52:13\nremarkable accomplishment you know and but more than that he also spearheaded\n52:18\nthe Abraham Accords now the possibility of establishing the Abraham Accords was\n52:23\nthere in the previous Democrat administ ation and they the state department\n52:29\ndefined it as impossible and they had for decades and even in the Trump Administration it took the Trump people\n52:35\na couple of years before they were willing to take the risk but they did take the risk and you know you may have\n52:41\nnoticed or you may not of is even after October 7th even after Iran did\n52:47\nabsolutely everything it could to drive the Muslim world into the hands of the\n52:52\nextremists they they pulled no punches in doing that it was a last ditch attempt to save their sad mullah\n53:00\nhides they Abraham Accords held and I know that if Biden would have been this\n53:07\nis an appalling fact if Biden would have been willing to give Trump some credit which he should have because Mr Trump\n53:13\nmight have just ridden off into the sunset If he if they had been willing to give the devil is due you know he should\n53:20\nhave got the Nobel Peace Prize for those abrahamic cors but even more importantly the Saudis were ready to sign that damn\n53:27\nAccord and Biden wouldn’t do it because it would shed positive light on Trump\n53:32\nand that was inexcusable it was inexcusable and my suspicions are that\n53:37\nyou know if things lay themselves out like we hope they might that the Saudis will sign the Abraham Accord in the next\n53:43\nyear or so and that’s a big deal you know it it it might even stop\n53:49\nthe you know there’s terrible animosity developing in many ways\n53:55\nbetween the extremists in the Islamic world and the West broadly speaking if\n54:00\nyou’re paying attention to X you saw what happened in Amsterdam this week which was just absolutely unforgivable\n54:07\nand almost completely underreported on the Legacy Media you know but there are\n54:13\npositive things Brewing within the Islamic world and it’s possible that the abrahamic Accords are a pathway in that\n54:19\ndirection and so and Trump he established those so no Wars and the\n54:24\nAbraham Accords and four years without being Hitler it’s like what the hell are you worried about he’s going to be\n54:30\nHitler now why now like what’s changed why would he be he’s not going to run\n54:36\nagain not least cuz he can’t but he’s also how old is he he’s 78 he’s like\n54:42\nfour more years I know he’s a tough bastard and he can keep well he is and he’s got a tremendous amount of energy\n54:49\nbut you know he’s got all these other people around him now my sense is he’ll be able to\n54:54\njust finish out these four years and end it with Grace and I\n55:02\nI given that he was President already for four years in his track record it’s like what are you worried about you\n55:08\nthink that was all a ruse and the thing about Trump is he didn’t know what he was doing that the\n55:14\nfirst time around you know he didn’t know who to hire he didn’t he did he wasn’t a politician he didn’t know anything about the ins and outs of\n55:20\nWashington really well he’s a whole different character now and you know his team is already started the difficult\n55:27\nprocess of hiring the you know tens 10,000 people that they have to staff\n55:32\nthe new Administration with they’re already all over that and so I think I think and pray that he’ll be much more\n55:40\nsuccessful the second time and hopefully he can be magnanimous you know and say to the Democrats who’ve been terrified\n55:47\ninto paralysis by the lies of the Legacy Media it’s like you know you guys can\n55:53\njust relax we’re not going on a Witch Hunt we’re just gonna get the economy rolling better than it\n55:59\never has in history and we’ve got the people behind us to do this we’ve got important things to do and so you know\n56:05\nsit back and watch and try not to fret too hard and you know the probability that the world’s coming to an end is\n56:12\nactually much lower than it was a week ago you know well you’ve already seen that you know you’ve already seen Hamas\n56:20\nmake peace noises and you’ve seen the same thing with China and Russia that’s not too bad for like three days and so\n56:27\nit wouldn’t surprise me it wouldn’t surprise me at all if Trump had a peace agreement in in hand with Russia and\n56:34\nUkraine before he takes office and I know I don’t know if you know this but there were peace offerings on the table\n56:40\nin May of 2022 and they were solid and the Russians were ready to sign and the Biden Administration refused it now you\n56:48\nknow I think there’s room for wide relevant differences of opinion about\n56:54\nthe situation in Ukraine and Russia but it is not like it’s not like the Russians won’t deal especially if\n57:01\nthey’re dealing with Trump and so I guess I’d ask the Democrats who are\n57:06\nreasonable it’s like well hold your nose for 6 months you know and try not to freak out and another thing to think\n57:13\nabout too and this is good in a general political sense I’ve thought about this very deeply you know in the biblical\n57:19\nstory of Exodus Moses is the archetypal leader and he leads his people away from\n57:26\nslavery and tyranny toward the promised land which is always what a leader does by the way through the desert of Doubt\n57:32\ntoward the promised land and Moses is severely punished at the end of his life\n57:38\nfor using Force when he’s called upon to use persuasion right so at near when the\n57:45\nIsraelites are are on the border of the promised land they run out of water it’s\n57:51\nphysical water and the Water of Life and God tells Moses to to to speak to the\n57:57\nrocks and have them deliver the water that will redeem the Israelites and instead Moses takes his staff of\n58:04\nauthority that Rod you know that can turn into a serpent that’s the magical symbol of healing by the way that the\n58:10\nPhysicians use he takes that rod and he he strikes the Rocks twice to force them\n58:16\nto comply and God’s response to that is that he sentences Moses to death before\n58:21\nhe reaches the promised land and that’s a hell of a punishment for someone who who had been a what would you say a\n58:30\ndevoted a devoted servant of God for decades and who undertook an unbelievably responsible task and who\n58:38\nUnited the fractious Israelites and took them away from slavery he’s punished why\n58:44\nbecause he used Force when he was asked to invite and convince and so one of the\n58:51\nthings to consider too when you’re trying to evaluate the claims of any given political leader any leader or\n58:57\nyourself for that matter is if you use fear and compulsion then you’re a tyrant in\n59:04\nWaiting you should formulate your offerings to people in the form of an invitation it’s like here’s something we\n59:11\ncould do together you know are you on board now it’s a little bit more difficult in the case of those people\n59:18\nwho just will not fly right you know like what do you do with criminals invitations don’t work very well and so\n59:24\nyou know you still have to have a cynical eye for people who misbehave\n59:29\nlet’s say but by and large you should be structuring your policies on an Invitational basis that’s also how you\n59:36\nFoster trust that was the big catastrophe with the covid debacle it’s like we’re going to use Force it’s like\n59:43\nokay we’re not going to trust public health for the next five decades how’s that for a response well that’s a bit\n59:50\ncounterproductive All Things Considered you know that’s a good thing to think about when you’re negotiating too it’s\n59:55\nlike you want people fully on board with your offer because then they bring their best to the table and you don’t do that\n1:00:02\nwith fear and you don’t do that with compulsion and so when you’re watching the climate Nazis for example brandish\n1:00:08\ntheir flags of Terror you think well you’re trying to frighten me into commiss into\n1:00:13\nsubmission maybe I don’t trust you then if your tools are fear and force we’re doing this for because it’s\n1:00:21\nbetter for you it’s because it’s going to bring a better future into being I see so you’re going to use fear and\n1:00:27\nforce to bring a better future into being I don’t think so I don’t think so and so that’s part\n1:00:34\nof what makes me skeptical of the climate well there’s 50 things that make me skeptical about it but one of them\n1:00:41\nthe most fundamental is likely I see you’re going to compel people to do this are you instead of making energy cheaper\n1:00:49\nwhich is what you would do if you were competent no we’re going to make it five times as expensive and we’re going to force you to use it it’s like okay got\n1:00:56\nit I understand they’ve done that in the UK right UK Energy prices are about five\n1:01:01\ntimes what they are in the US and that means all the poor people are way poorer\n1:01:06\nthan they would have to be and I don’t see that as a net gain so yeah I want to\n1:01:13\ndo a shout out we have a mutual friend Alex Epstein who wrote the book fossil Futures and his first book was a moral\n1:01:19\ncase for fossil fuels he has a great website energy\n1:01:26\nthe research and the data and the language so that they can speak effectively about energy and he’s just I\n1:01:31\nthink he’s absolutely brilliant has put so yeah yeah yeah yeah he’s a single-minded terror\n1:01:36\nEpstein yeah yeah he’s very useful to totally well let let you know what when we were talking um uh you know I have a\n1:01:45\nbook life gives to the giver which is this is a really clever way of me plugging my book while I’m interviewing you um but we were talking about giving\n1:01:52\nand you had made this comment which I loved because me and Dan Sullivan did a whole podcast on this where you said the\n1:01:58\nthe term and I didn’t initiate this you said it you’re like this whole uh this\n1:02:03\nterm uh give back it’s just it’s just not I think you maybe use toxic I’m not sure how you described it but I’m\n1:02:10\nfinally going to give back I’ve been robbing you people blind while I made my fortune and finally I’m going to give\n1:02:16\nback it’s like that’s a great message for capitalists and entrepreneurs it’s like you’re completely right that I was\n1:02:21\na thief but now I’m guilty and so it’s like one of the the things I’ve been talking to entrepreneurs about\n1:02:28\nespecially on the energy side it’s like you you got to give up your guilt it’s it’s pathological like maybe you have\n1:02:35\nsome things to be guilty about you should sort that out but with regards to your well seriously but with regards to\n1:02:41\nyour fundamental Enterprise it’s like you you you built a thriving business well what are you getting are guilty\n1:02:47\nabout that you think you if you stole from people while you’re doing it well then you need a slap and you should straighten yourself out but if you\n1:02:53\nactually built an Enterprise that works and that you’re off offering people a valid service and they’re accepting it\n1:02:59\nvoluntarily and you’re efficient enough to do that profitably and you employ a bunch of people and you’re growing it’s\n1:03:04\nlike that’s good you that might be good enough you don’t have to give back you\n1:03:10\nknow all that means is you’ve accepted all that leftist propaganda that property is theft or some bloody thing\n1:03:16\nproperty is theft except their property you know and so no no it’s it’s time for\n1:03:23\nespecially conservative entrepreneurs or just bu of ver in general to drop that idiot guilt I mean one of the I’ve been\n1:03:29\nin a lot of countries like a lot and and mostly in the west but one of the things\n1:03:34\nI can tell you for certain there is something about this country that’s different from every other country and\n1:03:42\nwhat’s different about this country is that the there is a default admiration\n1:03:48\nin the United States for Success the default assumption in the United States is you can succeed and you can deserve\n1:03:55\nit and then there’s another assumption that’s sort of right underneath that which is my children could be one of\n1:04:01\nthose people who succeeds and deserves it now everywhere else in the world including my home country there’s this\n1:04:07\nambivalence about success it’s like it’s uh well you know are you sure you’re not\n1:04:13\npart of the power mad patriarchy and just taking from people and you know that’s a question for your own\n1:04:18\nconscience if you’re a crooked dealer and some of what you’ve acred is a consequence of you know sharp trading\n1:04:23\nand lies well you know that’s on your own conscience and you bloody well will pay for it but if you’ve played a\n1:04:30\nstraight game and generally the only way to make a business that succeeds across any reasonable span of time is to play a\n1:04:35\nstraight game then you should stop being guilty about it you should be the\n1:04:41\nopposite of that I think it’s that this is what an Rand got right it’s like there’s an element to\n1:04:47\nentrepreneurial Kingdom building that’s as laudable as anything you could manage it’s not an easy thing to run an\n1:04:53\nefficient organization that offers people at genuine service at a competitive cost that they can use\n1:05:00\nvoluntarily and that they’re happy with that’s a moral\n1:05:07\naccomplishment yeah in your country it is definitely the case you know I mean I’ve gone through almost all of Europe\n1:05:14\nand and and met many people in all of those countries and I know Canada and the UK extremely well and Australia New\n1:05:21\nZealand no you guys there’s something unique about the United States and that that’s that American Dream element that\n1:05:29\nthat admiration for entrepreneurial Excellence that while you see that manifested in someone like Elon Musk and\n1:05:36\nyou know two thumbs up for that as far as I’m concerned and it would be lovely especially over the next four years if\n1:05:43\nall you entrepreneurial types stop letting the radical progressives have the moral upper hand because they’re for\n1:05:48\nthe poor it’s like no they’re not not a not even a bit all the bloody green\n1:05:54\nleftists have done in Europe is doomed the poor to extensive and deteriorating poverty that’s all they’ve done they\n1:06:00\nhaven’t cleaned up the environment one bit electricity is five times as expensive in Germany as it is in France\n1:06:07\nand they burn more coal than they did before they shot off their nuclear power plants so not only is energy expensive\n1:06:15\nand unreliable and provided by dictators it’s much filthier than it was they\n1:06:21\nfailed on every single front all the while raising ra you know flying the flag we’re for the poor it’s like I\n1:06:27\ndon’t think so if you’re making energy more expensive you hate the poor it’s\n1:06:32\nstraightforward you make people Rich by making energy cheap and so hopefully the Trump Administration will act on that as\n1:06:40\nhe did before and drive energy costs down so America can like bullet forward like this\n1:06:47\ncountry is capable of and establish an example for the world like you have so many times so that would be a lovely\n1:06:54\nthing to see and you know if you’re figuring out how to provide better services for lower cost which is what\n1:07:00\nall of you are doing at least to some degree in so far as your Enterprises are successful you are in service of the\n1:07:07\npoor and we know perfectly well we know with 100% certainty that free markets\n1:07:15\nand voluntary trade is the pathway out of poverty for the world there is no doubt about that and anybody who claims\n1:07:21\ndifferent is ideologically addled narcissistic and what would you say and\n1:07:27\nmorally posturing and so it’s time for you entrepreneurial types to drop your\n1:07:32\nguilt with regards to your success that I mean assuming that like I said you know you may have bits of your\n1:07:38\nconscience to come to terms with but so does everybody else and you can fail dismally and be an immoral rat too you\n1:07:46\nknow so the mere fact that you haven’t accomplished anything doesn’t indicate that you’re\n1:07:51\nvirtuous so [Applause]\n1:07:59\nso it’s really hard to get you excited about certain subjects I mean that’s that’s uh let me do some rapid fire\n1:08:06\nquestions then I’d love to take just a few minutes for some uh just a maybe a\n1:08:11\ncouple questions from the audience so two to four tops just because of timing\n1:08:16\nuh so favorite book Crime and Punishment uh solution to suffering\n1:08:27\nresponsibility most difficult time in your life oh there is a period of about 3\n1:08:34\nyears not very long ago where my wife and my daughter and I were both extremely ill and so that lasted about 3\n1:08:40\nyears and so that was three is a lot one is a lot three is a lot so and that was\n1:08:48\nreally brutal okay uh favorite place to travel Florence Italy is hard to beat\n1:08:57\num I went to this place called meteor in Greece too and man that was something else that’s a strange place that used to\n1:09:04\nbe an underwater ocean and it’s all it is is this landscape of mesas they’re\n1:09:09\nreally tall like 1500 ft and in this Stark mountainous landscape and it\n1:09:15\nthere’s 24 monasteries there built on these absolutely inaccessible Cliffs it’s it’s well they filmed a James Bond\n1:09:24\nmovie there for a reason it’s like it’s like shangra La Meteora deadly\n1:09:29\nremarkable place I’m I’m glad I’m getting my travel plans here too this is helpful um entrepreneur you\n1:09:37\nadmire well Elon Musk is definitely one of them I have a brother-in-law Jim Keller and uh he’s a he’s an absolute\n1:09:45\ngenius Jim he he’s worked for Elon he worked for Steve Jobs Jim designed all the computer chips and everything that\n1:09:51\nyou use all the apple chips virtually all the AMD chips all Intel chips Jim is\n1:09:56\nthe chip designer who moves from company to company competing with the last chip that he built and he’s built he’s\n1:10:03\nbuilding a printer at the moment that he thinks he’ll be able to print anything and so like a 3D printer yeah wow yeah\n1:10:13\nyeah Atomic level deposition so we’re going to see things come up in the next 10 years that we just can’t possibly\n1:10:20\nimagine and musk is definitely on the Forefront of that you know that those cars he’s build those self-driving cars\n1:10:27\nthose aren’t cars those are robots they just happen to have four wheels and musk is going to\n1:10:34\ntake all the data that those robots have already collected which is a lot and he’s going to put all that data into his\n1:10:40\nOptimus robots and that’s coming down the pipelines unbelievably quickly so\n1:10:45\nassuming that we don’t allow everything to go to hell in a hand basket which we certainly\n1:10:51\ncould we’re going to see things in the next 10 years that no one’s going to be able to believe\n1:10:56\nso and musk is definitely going to be at the Forefront of that he’s quite\n1:11:01\nthe improbable creature and now you’ve got him in your government assuming that\n1:11:07\neverybody allows him to live I guess we’ll find out about that but I got to find that Meme that I uh you know if\n1:11:15\nsome uh someone on my team could text me the meme I showed yesterday morning about Elon Musk now he you know it it it\n1:11:21\nwas um uh said along the lines of uh how stupid him to spend 44 million on\n1:11:27\nTwitter now he just controls three branches of government yeah no kidding yeah yeah you don’t second guessing Elon\n1:11:34\nMusk is a Fool’s game he doesn’t know what he’s doing it’s like how many Rockets have you sent to Mars well\n1:11:42\nseriously you know people are so presumptuous you know if he’d only done one impossible thing you’d think you\n1:11:47\ncould you know you could excuse that because you’re so embarrassed to not be him and you could excuse that and say\n1:11:53\nwell it’s government subsidies or it was handed to him which is all complete bloody rubbish cuz you can hand\n1:11:58\ngovernment subsidies to a fool forever and all that’ll happen is you’ll get 1,600 ft of High-Speed Rail built in\n1:12:05\nCalifornia in 20 years for $1 billion you know and so that happened right that\n1:12:11\nhappened and so but musk has done like five impossible things and so five is a\n1:12:17\nlot like one is a lot but five that’s just that’s really a lot and so second\n1:12:22\nguessing him it’s like why did he spend 40 billion dollar on Twitter it’s like cuz he knows things you don’t like many\n1:12:30\nthings books full of things so that’s great yeah he’s he’s an incredible entrepreneur yeah and I think he’s a\n1:12:36\ngood person or I said in my analysis or he’s an absolutely terrible person trying really hard to be good which is\n1:12:43\nthat’s even better and closer to the truth and I think it is the truth in his case cuz he’s a complicated guy he’s got\n1:12:49\nsome dark corners but you know he’s doing his best to aim up as you can tell by the fact that he’s shooting Rock to\n1:12:55\nMars and so and he’s very pro-human in his orientation and you know that’s\n1:13:00\nanother rule of thumb if you are talking to someone who says you know there there are too many people on the planet it’s\n1:13:06\nlike oh yeah what devil has your tongue there buddy which people do you mean\n1:13:12\nexactly and what’s your plan for the excess oh I didn’t mean that it’s like\n1:13:17\nno but the devil that had your tongue meant it you’re just a puppet you got to be careful when you’re a puppet of\n1:13:24\ngenocidal cliches and seriously I’m dead serious about that and so musk you know\n1:13:30\nmusk is very pro-human in his orientation and so since we’re all human\n1:13:36\nthat’s probably a good thing and it’s a good thing that someone like that is maybe on The Cutting Edge of the AI\n1:13:42\nRevolution because you know chat GPT and these other models that have been trained on woke stupidity they’ve got a\n1:13:49\nfew knots to untangle you know I think chat GPT was asked recently for example\n1:13:55\nif it was uh whether a nuclear Holocaust would be preferable to misgendering\n1:14:00\nCaitlyn Jennings and it said no and so that’s not good like seriously because\n1:14:07\nno matter what you think about Caitlyn Jenners Jenners Jennings Caitlyn Jenner Jenner Caitlyn Jenner i’ I’d pick\n1:14:16\nmisgendering her rather than the nuclear war but chat GPT wouldn’t and that’s not\n1:14:22\ngood those bloody systems they’re smart and they’re getting smarter fast like so\n1:14:27\nfast you can’t believe it and they’re not ethically oriented in the proper\n1:14:33\ndirection because they’ve been trained badly by Engineers who understand nothing about ethics and so I’m very\n1:14:39\nhappy that musk is in that game and at the moment on The Cutting Edge so you\n1:14:46\nknow thank God for small mercies or large Mercies in his case yeah totally\n1:14:52\ntotally uh favorite author well I doeski is my favorite author I\n1:14:58\nwould say uh philosopher n uh quick path out of sadness or anger\n1:15:06\ngratitude gratitude yeah that’s a hell are you so quick I mean this is like amazing that’s\n1:15:13\na practice does it does it occur to you how intelligent you\n1:15:18\nare I mean do you think about that in terms of how other people’s capabilities to access I’m not saying this\n1:15:26\ntoo um yeah I’m not being flipping about it I mean you you operate at a freaking\n1:15:32\nhigh level of you know there’s the figure of Lucifer the mythological figure of Lucifer is the intellect\n1:15:39\nunbridled right so Lucifer is the morning star who brings Enlightenment\n1:15:44\nand Lucifer the Mythos is that Lucifer was the highest angel in God’s Heavenly\n1:15:50\nKingdom gone most spectacularly wrong and that’s the intellect\n1:15:55\nif you start to worship the intellect you are in serious you are in serious trouble way more serious trouble than\n1:16:02\nyou think and so if you’re smart and you’ve been given a gift whatever the\n1:16:08\ngift is you understand that you’ve been given that gift and that you have a responsibility to use it properly and\n1:16:14\nthat’s true for any gift that you’ve been given and so you know that’s what I think about intelligence in general it’s\n1:16:20\na it’s a good servant but a very bad Master like a very bad master and so you\n1:16:26\nknow I try to make sure that whatever talents I have are oriented towards something that’s not me let’s say\n1:16:35\nso that’s yeah that I don’t have much of an answer beyond that uh scariest time in your life yeah\n1:16:43\nwell that was this period of yeah you know a lot of things have happened to me in the last eight years God that’s for\n1:16:49\nsure you know when everything blew up around me in 2016 my professorship became impossible\n1:16:55\nI lo I lost my clinical practice and the Canadian equivalent of the IRS was after me all in the same month so that kind of\n1:17:03\nsucked and the the the CRA that’s the IRS equivalent they admitted 6 months\n1:17:09\nlater that it was their mistake thank you very much gentlemen that was just what I needed and you know I two of my\n1:17:16\nsources of income were taken out as well as my clinical practice was devastated and like I said it became impossible for\n1:17:23\nme to continue as a professor that was a lot that was a lot to contend with at\n1:17:28\nonce now you know I didn’t open my mouth in the public sphere until I was very\n1:17:35\nmuch prepared and I had three sources of income not two and so losing two was annoying and dangerous but not\n1:17:43\ncatastrophic and I was also prepared because when I I produced some videos\n1:17:48\ncomplaining about the government in Canada but I’d already put up this was in by 2016 I already put put up about\n1:17:55\n200 hours of videos that were pretty much everything I’d ever said to a student in my entire professional career\n1:18:01\nand so you know when all this when the reputation Savages came for me I was\n1:18:09\npretty prepared but that all of this the last8 years have been very unsettling you know I mean everything’s been thrown\n1:18:15\nup in the air and then including you know I just about lost my wife and my daughter was very ill and so was I and\n1:18:22\nso and that all happened at once so so the whole 8-year period has\n1:18:27\nbeen incredibly intense but is that scary yeah I mean I get I I\n1:18:35\nthink even the success has to be I mean you’ve got literally millions of people online that watch and follow you\n1:18:42\nprobably daily and I don’t know how many countless tens of thousands maybe it’s in the millions of people that swear you\n1:18:49\njust have changed their life saved their life I mean yeah well that’s a pretty good deal really good deal you know and\n1:18:55\nwell and you know the the counterbalance to the online horror let’s say is that\n1:19:00\nmy life isn’t like my life isn’t what you’d expect if you only knew about me\n1:19:06\nonline so to speak you know I mean it seems if you watch the online spectacle that I’m\n1:19:13\ncontinually EMB battled and that’s not true it’s just not true my life is an\n1:19:18\nendless stream of events like this they’re very positive events you know the crowds are very welcoming\n1:19:25\nthe spirit is upward oriented um and when I’m out in public you know I have\n1:19:32\nsecurity and people keep an eye on me and we try not to do anything too stupid but all of the encounters I have with\n1:19:39\npeople in the actual world are ridiculously positive with you know tiny\n1:19:44\ntiny exceptions like one in 10,000 and it’s usually people who well they have\n1:19:50\nyou know they’re very respectful and they’re very polite and they have something meaning to say and they have\n1:19:55\nan anecdote to share that is worth listening to and that’s great and wherever I go you know which is a\n1:20:02\nremarkable thing is that wherever I go it’s very\n1:20:08\nweird it’s very weird to be able to go anywhere in the world and be among\n1:20:13\nfriends it’s very strange because of course people feel that they know me and I suppose they do because I’m not any\n1:20:19\ndifferent what you see online that’s what that’s who I am there’s\n1:20:25\nno facade certainly not one that’s maintainable for like 15 if you maintain\n1:20:32\na facade for 15 years you just become the facade right there’s no keeping\n1:20:37\nyourself separate from that so it’s a remarkable thing to be able to travel anywhere in the world and to be\n1:20:45\nwelcomed yeah that’s a good deal that’s a good\n1:20:50\ndeal that’s worth some suffering definitely you know and you can have\n1:20:55\nthat in the confines of your own organization if you play a straight game it’s like why wouldn’t people be happy\n1:21:01\nwith you you know you’re aiming up you’re bringing them along everything’s getting better for you and for\n1:21:07\nthem and then you can see how where can you take that you know\n1:21:13\nevery one of you has your own kingdom that’s one of the things that’s wonderful about the United States is\n1:21:19\nyou’ve got your own kingdom well what’s what’s going to rule there whatever you\n1:21:26\nwant you know that’s a good deal and so I have a great deal it’s a great deal\n1:21:33\nyeah that’s one of my goals with even genius network is just to help everyone have their own version of that in their\n1:21:39\nown life because um yeah we live in an infinite expans of upward opportunity\n1:21:46\nthat’s the nature of the world that’s the fundamental nature of the world and the people who say you\n1:21:51\nknow it’s a malthusian nightmare there’s only so much we have to Scrabble we have to squabble over the what would you say\n1:21:59\nthe the fragments that fall off the king’s table that’s complete nonsense\n1:22:05\nthere’s no limit to up just like there’s no limit to down and so and musk knows that for\n1:22:12\nexample and that’s the right way to think of the world the world is a realm of infinite possibility that’s the toou\n1:22:19\nvabo by the way that God’s spirit rested upon at the beginning of time it’s a pool of infinite possibility out of\n1:22:26\nwhich order is continually extracted and if you’re aiming upward and what would you say comporting yourself as a proper\n1:22:32\nimage of the Divine then you can bring the order that’s good into being and\n1:22:38\neveryone has that nature and opportunity you know and you’ve realized that in your own Enterprises and there’s no\n1:22:44\nlimit to the scope of that so that’s a lovely thing to know I don’t think there is a more\n1:22:51\nprofound truth than that fundamentally what’s the world made of the possibility that confronts your\n1:22:58\nexploratory Consciousness and it’s constrained you know because there’s a reality to it but\n1:23:04\nit’s also indefinite in terms of possibility\n1:23:10\nso so make the most of it see what you can do in your you know in the short\n1:23:15\nduration you have in front of you you know that Adventure uh we are past time but I want\n1:23:23\nto uh so you have a new book coming out we who wrestle with God yeah which I have wrestled with God my whole life and\n1:23:30\nuh you know a little bit of my background with my mother and I was raised Catholic most of you know that uh\n1:23:37\nGod is uh so I’d love for you to talk about your new book I’d also would like\n1:23:42\nall of you to um go and pre-order it on Amazon uh or audible if you prefer\n1:23:49\naudio uh I’ve not you just sent it to me like a few days ago so I will read it I\n1:23:54\nhaven’t read it yet but I’ve read the beginning part uh and uh I’d love for you to share what\n1:24:00\nthe book is about and if you don’t buy the book I will buy it for you because I’d like everyone to have and I’d love to at some point maybe bring you to 100K\n1:24:07\nmeeting have you do a conversation about it um but what is uh to share a little about the book well I I I’ll I’ll I’ll\n1:24:15\ngive you the brief version\n1:24:21\nso one of the claims of the postmodernists was\n1:24:27\nthat we see the world through a story and that’s technically true part\n1:24:33\nof the reason we’re in a culture War that’s deep part of the reason that the universities are in runes is because the\n1:24:40\npostmodern claim that we see the world through a story is true you can’t aggregate you can’t\n1:24:48\nnavigate your way through the world in mere consequence of the facts not least\n1:24:55\nbecause there’s an infinite number of facts there’s one fact for every phenomenon and so you can’t Orient\n1:25:02\nYourself by the facts you have to prioritize the facts and a description\n1:25:08\nof the way that we prioritize the facts is a story so when you go to a movie and you watch James Bond maneuver on his\n1:25:16\ngreat romantic adventure you see how he prioritizes his attention and his actions you see what his priorities are\n1:25:23\nand you embody his story you see the world through a story now the\n1:25:28\npostmodernists especially the French postmodernists who mostly were Marxist jump to the conclusion that the story\n1:25:35\nthat we see the world through is one of power that that’s the fundamental story\n1:25:41\nand that’s not true it’s not true scientifically it’s not true technically\n1:25:48\nand it’s not implementable because stories based on power are inefficient and they breed internal dissent and\n1:25:56\nRebellion they fail and I think that is an unassailable\n1:26:01\nfact by the way fact about stories let’s say so then the question is if we see\n1:26:06\nthe world through this through a story What story do we or should we see the world through and the biblical claim is\n1:26:14\nthat the proper story is one of sacrifice and that’s a hard thing for people to understand because the\n1:26:20\nbiblical stories present sacrifice in a rather anachronistic manner it’s not\n1:26:25\nobvious what the old testament’s prophets were up to when they built altars and offered some you know a burnt\n1:26:32\noffering to God but you see they they were acting out something that is\n1:26:39\nperfectly comprehensible once it’s explained to do something means to\n1:26:46\nsacrifice everything else everything you do is a sacrifice\n1:26:51\nevery glance you make is a sacrifice because you could be looking elsewhere every word you utter is a sacrifice\n1:26:57\nbecause you could have said something else every time you pay attention to someone rather than someone else you\n1:27:04\nsacrifice what you didn’t pay attention to to what you did pay attention to\n1:27:09\nthere’s no difference between sacrifice and work because when you work you sacrifice the the Delights of the\n1:27:16\npresent to the stability of the future and the community the community is\n1:27:21\nfounded on sacrifice and so is the psyche that’s the literal\n1:27:27\ntruth and so the human story is one of sacrifice and once you understand that\n1:27:33\nthe next question is what’s the highest form of sacrifice because if you’re going to\n1:27:39\nsacrifice you might as well do it properly rather than improperly and the biblical library because it is a library\n1:27:45\nis an investigation into the structure of upward oriented sacrifice so you can\n1:27:51\nimagine this in your own life as you people entrepreneurs have climbed the\n1:27:56\nladder of your own life you can imagine that there were decision points that you\n1:28:02\ncame a you came across where you had to leave some things behind so that you\n1:28:07\ncould become who you were aiming at becoming and that upward spiraling\n1:28:13\nspiraling process of transformation that’s the sacrificial adventure of Life\n1:28:19\nAbraham himself you know he starts out privileged wealthy y protected he\n1:28:25\ndoesn’t have to lift a finger he has wealthy parents and the voice of God comes to him as the voice of sacrificial\n1:28:31\nAdventure it’s like leave your zone of comfort and go out and have the terrible\n1:28:37\nadventure of your life and Abraham does that and at each after each episode\n1:28:43\nafter each episode of transformation he rekindles his affirmation to aim at the\n1:28:49\nhighest possible Target and as a consequence his personality improves every upward and then quality of the\n1:28:56\nsacrifices that he’s called upon to offer become higher and higher it culminates in the case of Abraham with\n1:29:03\nhim having to offer his son and what that means in your own life is that as you develop upward as you\n1:29:09\nwalk up Jacob’s Ladder let’s say the depth of the sacrifices that you will be\n1:29:15\ncalled upon to undertake to continue your spiraling process upward will increase in magnitude and meaning\n1:29:22\nsignificance and that’s the pathway of life it’s the never ending sacrificial\n1:29:28\nVoyage up the ladder to heaven and so I explain that in this book and I talk\n1:29:34\nabout the story of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Jacob and um the Tower of\n1:29:40\nBabel which is what we inhabit now and the story of Abraham and the story of\n1:29:46\nMoses and the story of Elijah and Elijah is the first prophet who you are going to ask some questions about passion you\n1:29:53\nknow is passion passion sufficient to run an Enterprise the answer to that is no you have to consult your conscience\n1:29:59\ntoo you know passion pulls you forward but you have to stay on the straight and narrow path and conscience is the Divine\n1:30:06\nvoice that tells you when you’re violating the intrinsic moral order and\n1:30:12\ngo Elijah pre presents God as the voice of conscience within the still Small\n1:30:17\nVoice that’s very much worth knowing and so what I’ve done with we who wrestle\n1:30:22\nwith God is to take these stories and they are the stories upon which American civilization is founded there’s no\n1:30:29\nhistorical doubt about that and I tried to explain what the stories mean and why\n1:30:35\nthey’re true why they’re a deep form of Truth and why you need to know them because\n1:30:42\nyou live in a story and once you know that it’s like okay what’s the story going to be and\n1:30:50\nthe story of Abraham for example that’s the story it’s not the story of Comfort it’s not the story of security it’s not\n1:30:56\nthe story of wealth it’s the story of romantic adventure and that’s human\n1:31:02\nbeings like we’re not designed for Comfort we’re not designed for\n1:31:07\nsafety we all die we’re our lives are bounded by mortality we’re here for the\n1:31:15\nadventure and so that’s the right way to construe yourself it’s like what can you\n1:31:20\npossibly manage what What can you extract out of the realm of possibility\n1:31:26\nthat confronts you that justifies the constraints of your existence right what\n1:31:33\nremarkable things can you do that justify the fact of your\n1:31:38\nsuffering all that’s a question for everyone and it’s a wonderful thing to wrestle with think that was difficult\n1:31:46\nbut it was worth it right that’s a good deal for you that’s a good deal to offer\n1:31:51\npeople here’s something difficult but worth it yeah that’s a lot different\n1:31:57\nthan infantile satiation let’s say right or self-serving Hedonism or nihilistic\n1:32:06\ncollapse or the notion that we have nothing to talk about it’s only a power dispute between the two of us dismal\n1:32:14\nbloody stories and self-defeating so that story of upward sacrificial\n1:32:20\nAdventure that’s the that’s the Story the second book in this series will be a\n1:32:27\ninvestigation into the story of job and into the passion story I have a seminar\n1:32:33\ncoming out on the daily wire on the gospels which was partly a precursor to the second book in this series so\n1:32:42\nthe what would you say the central message of the Gospel accounts is that\n1:32:48\nyou’re called upon to offer up everything in the service of what’s highest everything right\n1:32:54\nFamily Friends Community wealth life but you\n1:33:00\nthink well how could you possibly do anything better than to offer everything you have\n1:33:05\nto what’s highest what could possibly be better than that you serve your own\n1:33:12\nwhims that doesn’t even work for twoy olds so that’s what the book is about\n1:33:19\nsacrificial adventure and what that means and why that’s the necess necessarily by necessity the foundation\n1:33:26\nof free and productive the free and productive communities that\n1:33:33\npeople what would you say unite voluntarily to produce and\n1:33:39\nmaintain and I think it’s I think the story is Rock Solid and I think we’re at a point this is part of this\n1:33:46\nremarkable the remarkable nature of the present I think the scientific accounts\n1:33:52\nand the theological accounts have converged and I tried to make that a\n1:33:57\ncriteria for the arguments that I made in the book it’s like if it didn’t work scientifically and theologically I just\n1:34:03\ndidn’t use the argument so it’s quite fun it’s terrifying\n1:34:13\nbut where there’s a lot of Terror there’s a lots of possibility right that’s a great quote\n1:34:20\nwherever there’s a lot of Terror there’s a lot of possibility yeah well that’s dragons and treasure\n1:34:26\npeople Jordan Peterson\n1:34:38\neveryone this is a organized systematic devious nefarious project by these\n1:34:45\nElites they want to Rob us of our sovereignty and they’re creating a generation of of Americans that you know\n1:34:52\nthat will do what they’re told and that won’t stand up to Authority this is all about you know unraveling\n1:34:59\nthe corruption and restoring the freedoms of our country and restoring self sovereignty and

    "text": "My father loved to visit places.\nMy mother did not.\nThis was a quandary for most of their married life.\nUntil their grandchildren arrived.\nIn their latter life, they both enjoyed travel to nearby and far places, especially when accompanied by their grandchildren.\nI now understand better my parent’s view on traveling or vacationing\nFor my father, the traveling represented a time away from responsibilities, see and learn new things, and taste new dishes.\nMeanwhile, my mother recognized that tasks and chores do not take breaks and will still be around after the break.\nBut once out of the home, she was more enthusiastic about the new place and new tastes.\n\nWhen my father was 71 and my mother 69 we visited parts of Europe as a family. We worried that they would slow down the group.\nThere was no need for that.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed visiting sites associated with the birth and flourishing of Western Civilization\n\n\n\nZaanse Schans, October 2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing we couldn’t arrange was return to their 고향 (故鄕).\nThe Korean Wikipedia has three definitions.\n\nthe place of birth and growing up\nthe place where your ancestors lived for generations\nthat place you miss and cherish deep in your heart.\n\nMy mother and father knew exactly the place of their birth and childhood home. If the borders were abolished, I think they could lead a group of visitors right up to the neighborhood.\nI imagine, they could have done that even in their 80s.\n\nA few years after the European visit, we got to visit 백령도 (白翎島). An island, about 200 kilometers from Incheon Airport, or a 4-hour ferry ride. The island is inhabited by 5000 persons, including Mom’s cousin on her mother’s side.\n\n\n\nWith the cousin in front of local Presbyterian Church, June 2007\n\n\nWhen we arrived on the island. I didn’t need an introduction, I was instantly accepted as a family, by virtue of being my mom’s son. My 2 sons were automatically recognized as an extended family.\nThis was a rare and memorable welcoming for me as a son of refugees from the Northern Korea.\nMom’s cousin and his wife provided a feast and took us around the island. The island is roughly 50 square kilometers or 1/15 of Singapore.\n\n\n\nAt mom’s cousin’s Home, light on spices, closer to North Korean cuisine\n\n\nMany of its residents are from nearby counties in North Korea. Some of these are less than 10 miles from the coast of 백령도 (白翎島).\nThey came to the island in a temporary arrangement. They were to return, once the conflict was resolved.\n\nThat was nearly 74 years ago.\n\n\n\n콩돌해안, beach on the east side of the island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t know whether I will step foot on North Korea.\nEven if I did, who would guide me to our family’s hometown.\nAnd then if we did meet the extended family, what would the conversation consist of.\nNevertheless, I hope to fulfill the wishes of my parents and visit those places and say.\n\n“I am home (ただいま)”\n\nand they will respond,\n\n’Welcome Home”\n\nただいま帰りました (Tadaima kaerimashita)\n\nI have returned, indeed."

    "text": "I have many questions, and I am satisfied with answers I have thus far.\nThe ones given by my family, especially mom and dad who demonstrated what a consecrated life is.\nA religious leader defined a need, architectonic one.\n\nwhat might be called modern man’s architectonic needs—that is, our deep needs to discern some design, purpose, pattern, or plan regarding human existence.\n\nMy needs were basic.\nHave enough to eat, something to wear, learn something that can support a family.\nSo far in this life, not only were my desires met but unexpressed dreams were fulfilled.\n\nDictionary defines architectonic as the systematic structure of our knowledge.\nGrowing up, I relied on the knowledge structure of my immediate family.\nThe strong, tight-knit, loving people of Northern Korea.\nSpecifically, 함경남도 and 평안남도.\nThey were believers when the Soviet backed regime disallowed religion.\nThey were the builders when all was lost during the War.\nThey were that generation that created the miracle of Han River.\n\nWhen we were poor and barely met basic needs, we always felt that there was a plan.\nWe were moving in the right direction with the aid of a providential force - unseen but felt.\nLater, as a family, we learned about the Plan and the Role of Redeemer.\nThat there is a design for our existence in this life and another life afterwards.\n\nAnd the purpose of this life is,\n\n“This life is the time for men to prepare to meet God” (Alma 34:32)\n\nFurthermore,\n\nAnd this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. (John 17:3)\n\n24 But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.\n25 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.\n\nMy testimony,\nOur lives are eternal and can be fulfilling as we live a life centered on Christ’s teachings.\nThere is a plan for our happiness.\nAdam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."

    "text": "I remember watching my father preparing his lunch.\nI would have missed seeing it, except he prepared his lunch, the night before.\nMy father and mother drove together and needed to leave early.\nFirst to Washington DC to drop off mother, who never had a driver’s license.\nPacking his own lunch meant he saved on money but he seldom had variety.\n\nHis chosen vocation or the one assigned by life, was that he worked away from city centers.\nA quarry, with plenty space and water running through it. Like a scene from the cartoon series Flintstones\nOnce I went to his work place. AH Smith, the company that sponsored his visa had an operation near present day Greenbelt Metro Station.\nAnother time his work was in Silver Hill Area. A food truck came and nearly all people purchase either a drink, food or snack.\nBut not my father, he and I ate simple food that he had prepared.\n\nI wonder if he ever felt that he could be in a different role. Did he ever consider taking a role that would allow him to work from home.\nIf those thoughts crossed his mind, he never showed it. I was brought up in an environment of stable family life.\nWhereas, he himself grew up in a home where his father often neglected his duty. Grandfather’s life was consumed with alcohol and its attendant vices. Gambling was particularly a problem for him.\nI am grateful that my father neither smoked or drank. That alone set his path to a vastly different destination.\n\nI am also grateful that he took time to teach me to work. By demonstrating the role of a father and the meaning of economic provider. The value of work, thrift and fortitude\nCreated and forged in years of participating and surviving a war\nYears of working in a quarry.\nHave had number of days that are difficult. And there will be more in the future.\nHowever, I am going to persevere like my father did Thanks Dad, because you showed how to take the work to a child"

She helped me during her internship and afterwards with encouraging letters. Those meant much then, as they do now.\nI made good progress, and by the 2nd year, I had sufficient comprehension that those special courses were not needed.\nDue to all these attention and care, I was prepared to embark on a life as a first generation immigrant.\nLooking back those were some trying days, but we expected difficult days as economic refugees.\nAlso compared to my parents who were the true first generation immigrants, my life was not difficult at all.\nWatching my parents toil without murmuring set the stage for our family to be established both economically and spiritually in this land.\nThanks to teachers, volunteers, employers, congregation members that helped us settle in this country many decades ago.\nAs Sister K and I made home in a light drizzle, after the concert.\nWe discussed how challenging life is for the rising generation.\nWill they have all of the opportunities and a chance to own physical manifestations.\nThen our thoughts reverted back to the message and resolve of those refugee participants.\nWe are not currently in or likely be facing uncertainties or decisions that involve threats to our lives or freedom.\nIt is written in the Book of Mormon and spoken by prophets2,\nThank you brave souls that continue to arrive in this land of opportunity and embrace the opportunity to serve the God of this land and over all of the earth."

philosopher and the founder of Taoism. His teachings revolve around the concept of Tao, which can be translated as “The Way” or “The Way of Nature.” Here are some key ideas from Lao Tzu’s teachings:\n\n\n1. Tao: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of living in harmony with the Tao, the natural and universal principle that underlies everything in existence. The Tao is seen as an impersonal force that cannot be fully understood or described but can be experienced.\n\n\n2. Wu-wei: Lao Tzu advocated for the principle of Wu-wei, which can be translated as “non-action” or “effortless action.” It involves aligning oneself with the natural flow of the Tao and acting without unnecessary force or resistance. It is about allowing things to unfold naturally rather than trying to control or manipulate them.\n\n\n3. Simplicity and Spontaneity: Lao Tzu emphasized the value of simplicity and spontaneity in life. He believed that by letting go of desires, attachments, and excessive ambition, one can achieve inner peace and harmony. By embracing simplicity and being in tune with the natural rhythms of life, one can live a more fulfilling existence.\n\n\n4. Humility and Detachment: Lao Tzu emphasized the importance of humility and detachment. He encouraged individuals to let go of ego and the need for recognition, and instead cultivate a sense of modesty and detachment from material possessions and social status. By doing so, one can attain true wisdom and freedom.\n\n\n5. Paradoxical Thinking: Lao Tzu often employed paradoxical statements to challenge conventional wisdom and encourage deeper reflection. He believed that reality is multifaceted and cannot be fully grasped through dualistic thinking. By embracing paradoxes and transcending binary concepts, individuals can gain a more profound understanding of the nature of existence.\n\n\nOverall, Lao Tzu’s teachings revolve around living in harmony with the natural order, embracing simplicity, acting without force, and cultivating humility and detachment. His philosophy encourages individuals to let go of unnecessary desires and attachments in order to achieve inner peace and align themselves with the profound wisdom of the Tao.\n\n\nBuddhism is a spiritual tradition that originated in ancient India and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. The teachings of Buddhism, often referred to as the Dharma, offer guidance on how to live a meaningful and enlightened life. Here are some key teachings of Buddhism:\n\n\n1. The Four Noble Truths: These are considered the foundational teachings of Buddhism. They are:\n   a. Dukkha (Suffering): Life is characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, and impermanence.\n   b. Samudaya (Origin of Suffering): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.\n   c. Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering): It is possible to end suffering by letting go of attachments and desires.\n   d. Magga (Path to the Cessation of Suffering): The Noble Eightfold Path leads to the cessation of suffering.\n\n\n2. The Noble Eightfold Path: This path provides practical guidelines for living a moral, balanced, and mindful life. It consists of eight interconnected aspects:\n   a. Right View: Understanding the true nature of reality and the Four Noble Truths.\n   b. Right Intention: Cultivating positive intentions and letting go of harmful thoughts.\n   c. Right Speech: Speaking truthfully, kindly, and avoiding harmful speech.\n   d. Right Action: Acting in ways that are ethical, compassionate, and non-harming.\n   e. Right Livelihood: Engaging in a profession that promotes well-being and avoids harm.\n   f. Right Effort: Cultivating wholesome qualities and letting go of unwholesome ones.\n   g. Right Mindfulness: Developing present-moment awareness and non-judgmental observation.\n   h. Right Concentration: Cultivating focused and tranquil states of mind through meditation.\n\n\n3. Impermanence: Buddhism emphasizes the understanding that everything in life is impermanent. All conditioned phenomena, including ourselves, are subject to change and decay. Recognizing this truth helps us let go of attachments and reduces suffering.\n\n\n4. No-Self (Anatta): Buddhism teaches that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul. Instead, our existence is characterized by a constantly changing flow of physical and mental processes. Understanding the absence of a fixed self leads to a more liberated and interconnected view of reality.\n\n\n5. Compassion and Loving-kindness: Buddhism emphasizes the cultivation of compassion and loving-kindness towards all beings. This includes developing empathy, extending goodwill, and working towards alleviating the suffering of others.\n\n\n6. Mindfulness and Meditation: Buddhism places great emphasis on the practice of mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness involves being fully present and aware of one’s thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Meditation cultivates concentration, insight, and a deep understanding of the nature of reality.\n\n\n7. Karma and Rebirth: Buddhism teaches the concept of karma, which states that our intentional actions have consequences. Positive actions lead to positive outcomes, while negative actions lead to suffering. Buddhism also holds the belief in rebirth, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth until one achieves enlightenment and liberation from this cycle.\n\n\nThese teachings of Buddhism provide a comprehensive framework for individuals to cultivate wisdom, compassion, and inner peace while navigating the challenges of existence. Buddhism encourages personal inquiry, self-reflection, and the development of ethical behavior and mental well-being.\n\n\nChristianity is a major world religion that is centered on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Its teachings are based on the Bible, particularly the New Testament, and vary across different denominations. Here are some key teachings of Christianity:\n\n\n1. The Nature of God: Christianity teaches the belief in one God who is eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good. God is seen as the creator and sustainer of the universe and is revealed as Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit (the Trinitarian nature of God).\n\n\n2. Jesus Christ as Savior: Christianity holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Messiah who came to save humanity from sin and offer eternal life. Jesus’ life, teachings, death on the cross, and resurrection are central to Christian faith and provide redemption and reconciliation with God.\n\n\n3. Salvation through Faith: Christianity teaches that salvation is a gift from God, not something earned by human efforts. It is received through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, acknowledging His sacrificial death and accepting His forgiveness. Christians believe in the importance of repentance, turning away from sin, and receiving God’s grace.\n\n\n4. Love, Compassion, and Morality: Christianity emphasizes the commandment to love God and love one’s neighbor as oneself. Christians are encouraged to show compassion, kindness, forgiveness, and generosity to others. Christian moral teachings encompass a wide range of principles, including honesty, integrity, respect for life, sexual purity, and social justice.\n\n\n5. The Bible as Sacred Scripture: The Bible is considered the inspired Word of God in Christianity. It consists of the Old Testament, which contains the religious texts of Judaism, and the New Testament, which focuses on the life and teachings of Jesus and the early Christian community. The Bible serves as a guide for faith, doctrine, ethics, and spiritual growth.\n\n\n6. Worship and Sacraments: Christianity emphasizes communal worship and the gathering of believers. Worship practices vary across different Christian traditions but often involve prayer, singing hymns, reading scripture, preaching, and participating in sacraments. Sacraments, such as baptism and the Eucharist (also known as Communion or the Lord’s Supper), are considered sacred rituals that convey spiritual grace.\n\n\n7. Resurrection and Eternal Life: Christianity teaches the belief in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which signifies victory over sin and death. Christians have hope in the promise of eternal life and the resurrection of the dead. The final judgment is also a belief in Christianity, where individuals are held accountable for their actions and receive their eternal destiny.\n\n\nThese teachings provide a foundation for Christian faith and practice, focusing on a personal relationship with God, the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, moral living, and the hope of eternal life. Different Christian denominations may have additional beliefs and practices that shape their particular expressions of Christianity.\n\n\nIslam is a monotheistic religion that originated in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. Its teachings are based on the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Here are some key teachings of Islam:\n\n\n1. Oneness of God: Islam emphasizes the belief in the oneness of God, known as Tawhid. Muslims believe in the absolute unity and uniqueness of Allah, who is eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, and merciful. Associating partners with God (shirk) is considered a major sin.\n\n\n2. Prophethood: Muslims believe that God has sent prophets throughout history to guide humanity. The final and most significant prophet is Muhammad, who Muslims believe to be the last messenger and the seal of prophethood. The Quran is believed to be the final revelation from God.\n\n\n3. Five Pillars of Islam: These are the core practices that shape the life of a Muslim:\n   a. Shahada: The declaration of faith, which states, “There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.”\n   b. Salat: The ritual prayer performed five times a day, facing the Kaaba in Mecca.\n   c. Zakat: Giving a portion of one’s wealth to the less fortunate as a form of obligatory charity.\n   d. Sawm: Fasting from dawn to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan.\n   e. Hajj: The pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, which is obligatory for those physically and financially able to undertake it.\n\n\n4. Quran as the Word of God: The Quran is considered the literal word of God, revealed in Arabic to Prophet Muhammad. It serves as a guide for Muslims in matters of faith, worship, morality, and daily life. Muslims strive to live in accordance with its teachings and seek guidance from it.\n\n\n5. Moral and Ethical Principles: Islam emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior and the pursuit of righteousness. Muslims are encouraged to be honest, just, compassionate, and kind. They are instructed to avoid lying, stealing, cheating, backbiting, and engaging in any form of harm or injustice.\n\n\n6. Brotherhood and Community: Islam promotes a sense of brotherhood and unity among Muslims. Muslims are encouraged to support and care for one another, and to contribute to the well-being of society. Social justice, equality, and the rights of individuals are emphasized.\n\n\n7. Judgment and Afterlife: Islam teaches that individuals will be held accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment. Believers who have lived a righteous life and followed God’s commands will be rewarded with Paradise, while those who have engaged in evil and rejected God’s guidance may face punishment in Hell.\n\n\nThese teachings provide the foundation for Islamic belief and practice, focusing on the worship of Allah, adherence to moral principles, and the pursuit of a righteous and compassionate life. It is important to note that there are various interpretations and practices within the Islamic tradition, and different cultures and communities may have additional customs and practices that shape their expression of Islam.\n\n\nHinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world, with a rich and diverse set of teachings. It encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, but there are some fundamental teachings that are commonly emphasized. Here are key teachings of Hinduism:\n\n\n1. Dharma: Dharma refers to the moral and ethical duties and responsibilities that individuals are expected to fulfill in their lives. It encompasses righteousness, duty, and the harmonious functioning of society. Dharma varies according to one’s age, caste, occupation, and stage of life.\n\n\n2. Karma and Reincarnation: Hinduism teaches the concept of karma, which is the law of cause and effect. It states that every action has consequences, and individuals accumulate karma based on their actions in past and present lives. Reincarnation, or the cycle of birth and rebirth, is believed to be influenced by one’s accumulated karma.\n\n\n3. Moksha: Moksha refers to liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth. It is the ultimate goal of Hinduism, representing liberation from the cycle of suffering and union with the divine. Moksha is achieved through self-realization, spiritual growth, and the realization of one’s true nature, which is ultimately connected to the divine.\n\n\n4. Atman and Brahman: Hinduism teaches the existence of an eternal, unchanging, and divine essence within all beings, called the Atman. The Atman is considered identical to the ultimate reality, known as Brahman, which is the ultimate source and essence of the universe.

    "section": "Appendix",
    "text": "Appendix\nFibonacci was an Italian mathematician born around 1170 and widely known for introducing the Fibonacci sequence to Western mathematics. His real name was Leonardo of Pisa, but he is commonly referred to as Fibonacci, which stands for “son of Bonacci.” He played a crucial role in popularizing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system (the one we use today) in Europe through his book “Liber Abaci” (The Book of Calculation), written in 1202.\n\nKey Contributions:\n\nFibonacci Sequence:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.\nThe sequence is found in many natural phenomena, like the arrangement of leaves on plants, the branching of trees, and the spirals of shells.\n\n“Liber Abaci”:\n\nIn this book, Fibonacci introduced the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals (0-9) to Europe, replacing the less efficient Roman numeral system.\nHe also demonstrated practical arithmetic applications in commerce, such as currency conversions, interest calculations, and the measurement of goods.\n\nMathematical Legacy:\n\nFibonacci’s work had a significant influence on European mathematics. While the Fibonacci sequence is his most famous contribution, his advocacy for the Hindu-Arabic numeral system transformed how calculations were performed across Europe.\n\n\nIn summary, Fibonacci was a pioneering mathematician whose work greatly advanced the use of arithmetic in the Western world and left an enduring legacy with the Fibonacci sequence, which continues to find applications in mathematics, science, and art.\nThe Fibonacci sequence is significant in both mathematics and nature due to its unique properties and wide-ranging applications. The sequence is defined as a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.\nHere are some of the key reasons the Fibonacci sequence is important:\n\n\n1. Mathematical Properties:\n\nGolden Ratio: As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio of successive terms approaches the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618), a mathematical constant denoted by the Greek letter φ (phi). The closer you get to higher terms in the sequence, the closer the ratio between consecutive terms gets to φ.\nRecursive Nature: The sequence is a recursive series, which means it has a simple rule for generating the next term based on the previous ones, making it fundamental in understanding sequences, patterns, and recursive algorithms.\nBinet’s Formula: The Fibonacci numbers can be expressed explicitly using Binet’s formula, which involves the Golden Ratio, showing the deep connection between the sequence and this irrational number.\n\n\n\n2. Natural Phenomena:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is often referred to as nature’s numbering system because it appears frequently in biological settings. - Plant Growth: The arrangement of leaves, seeds, and flowers often follows Fibonacci numbers. For example: - The number of petals on many flowers is a Fibonacci number (e.g., lilies have 3 petals, daisies often have 34, 55, or 89 petals). - The spirals in sunflowers and pinecones follow Fibonacci numbers. - Animal Patterns: The spiral shapes in snail shells and the patterns of hurricanes also follow Fibonacci proportions. - Reproductive Patterns: Fibonacci’s sequence describes the idealized reproduction rates of rabbits and other populations in theoretical models.\n\n\n3. Applications in Science and Technology:\n\nComputer Science: The sequence is used in algorithms, particularly in recursive functions and sorting algorithms. For example, Fibonacci search is an algorithm used for searching in sorted arrays, and the Fibonacci heap is used in optimization problems in computer science.\nData Structures: The sequence is important in constructing trees and models of data structures in computational systems.\nCryptography: Fibonacci numbers are sometimes used in pseudorandom number generators and encryption systems.\n\n\n\n4. Art and Architecture:\n\nGolden Ratio and Aesthetics: The connection between the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio has influenced art, architecture, and design, as the ratio is believed to result in visually pleasing proportions. Many artists and architects have used the Golden Ratio in their work, including Leonardo da Vinci.\nDesign and Composition: The Fibonacci sequence is used in the composition of paintings, photography, and even in product design to create aesthetically balanced and harmonious results.\n\n\n\n5. Financial Markets:\n\nFibonacci Retracement: In technical analysis, traders use Fibonacci ratios (23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, etc.) to predict support and resistance levels in stock prices and other financial markets. This helps in identifying possible reversal points during market trends.\nWave Theory: The Elliott Wave Theory, used in financial market analysis, relies on the Fibonacci sequence to predict the movement of asset prices.\n\n\n\n6. Mathematical Puzzles and Games:\n\nFibonacci numbers are used in various puzzles, games, and recreational mathematics problems, helping people explore patterns, sequences, and the nature of growth.\n\n\n\nSummary:\nThe Fibonacci sequence is significant because it bridges the gap between mathematics and the natural world, appearing in biological systems, aesthetics, and even human-designed systems like computer science and finance. Its relationship with the Golden Ratio makes it essential in both theoretical and applied fields, including science, art, and market analysis."

The music that not only entertains but touches and moves the soul.\nThe transition point is age independent but rather exposure or experience dependent.\nSoul music speaks to and about life’s common experience, and often – its struggles.\nAs Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote in Solitude\n“Laugh and the World laughs with you, Weep, and you weep alone…”\nHappy sounds, pervaded by popular songs are universally liked and followed.\nDeep anguish and sorrow conveyed in the lyrics of soulful music seems to be almost hidden from society - unpopular.\nHowever, they are felt deeply and widely and followed by the masses – quietly yet purposefully.\nMany of them have traveled more than halfway to their destinations in life or have experiences that qualify them for that group.\nPresent day cultures does not promote or recognize suffering, to the same degree as achievements and triumphs.\nHowever, for me, if I am feeling sad, I feel better by singing a soulful song rather than a cheerful, popular song.\nOne feels comforted and healed.\nWhy is that so?\nFeel better by commiserating.\nElements of a Soulful Song\nLimitations and seeming cruelties of life.\nWhether it be love, both expressed and unexpressed.\nLife’s pursuit, achieved or given up.\nMemories kept and almost rekindled\nSoulful songs deal with disappointments rather thaforn successes, for the most part.\nA Hope the future. Despite challenges and a right to be despondent, the song echoes a hope for the future.\nTogether, with love, and help from Above, we can overcome present day sadness and be victorious.\nLife’s lessons learned from small things Observes small actions, slight touches. Soulful artists are impressionistic, capturing those images for the rest of us. Putting words and music to those moments that we want to capture and remember\nSong ages better than almost anything Song improves over the years and new meanings are generated or created.\nLyrics are easy to understand at first but the meaning changes over time It is very difficult to translate into another language, either keep the rhythm or invent new phrases to capture the full meaning.\nSad melodies and lyrics create an environment Remember the times, place and person. Popular music does this as well. Soul music does it more efficiently.\nAble to bring to mind the feelings of first love, lost ones, with an opening line.\n“이른 아침에 잠에서 깨어, 너를 바라 볼 수 있다면”\nIs an opening line from 사랑을 위하여 by Korean crooner, 김종환\nIf I am privileged to see, the first thing in the early morning, is you.\nAnd other lines such as,\n내가 아플때보다 니가 아파할때가, 내 가슴을 철들게 했고\nI learned to empathize and grew from your suffering rather than mine.\nAnd finally\n오래 두어도 진정 변하지 않는, 사랑으로 남게 해주오\nThe kind of love that endures through ages, let that be ours.\nSoulful music stretches the vocal range of singers, musically representing the struggles of listeners.\nAs the singer’s voice struggles, and almost cracks, a new level of sound is achieved and appreciated.\nThese song can be enjoyed, passively.\nTo enjoy maximally, take a live recording, or a K-Oke Version if you prefer, take it to a quiet place (for the sake of others), put it on a loop mode, and sing along until you can’t sing no more or you feel better.\nMistake and all,\nIt will be the most satisfying performance.\nThat is what I intend to do all week long.\n\nBeatles sang,\nHey you’ve got to hide your love away"

I mostly listen, working on a skill that I should have learned a long time ago. There are no distractions or worldly influences, unless having a non-carrier phone as a camera is considered a distration.\nWe often take a break to see the cloud patterns or predict the day’s weather based on the wind pattern. We adjust our meeting schedule to accommodate the rotation of the earth around the sun and the resulting changes to sun (moon) rise timetable\nIt has become a daily practice or routine for Sister K and I\n\n\n\nNoon, October 2023\n\n\nWhen the job is 30+ miles (50km) away and the region is expanding, one can spend couple hours on the road. Often the public transportation seemed more civilized, even though it added an additional hour to the rigor.\nThat had been my lot for the vast majority of my adult life. Even when I was overseas my commute was at least an hour each way.\nI’ve listened to my fair share of audiobooks and conference talks on a number of electronic devices. Learned to make those hours somewhat productive but still I didn’t get to spend that time at home. Away from my primary duties and the role.\nThen two years ago an opportunity came up that reduced my commute time by 75%.\nI joined a company 7 miles from home. Initially, instead of taking the 7AM FrontRunner, I took the time to catch up on social media generated happenings.\nI wasn’t taking advantage of the time allotted me. I needed a new way of starting a day.\nI began by visiting nearby hills. Initial few days or weeks were bit difficult. After that adjustment period, the routine became part of my life\nIt became a time to reflect, a time for gratitude, and a time for renewing. And the bonus of a physical exercise.\nI’ve been invited Sister K to join me\n\nI told Sister K a few days ago,\n\nthanks for coming each day for the hike and the exercise\n\nshe replied\n\noh it’s not for the exercise I come up here, it is to commune\n\nso I gave up commute and replaced it with a commune which dictionary defines as\n\nshare one’s intimate thoughts or feelings with (someone), especially on a spiritual level. e.g. “the purpose of praying is to commune with God”\n\n\n\n\n7:20AM, May 2004"

My favorite nearly-non-existent specification is “off-axis reponse.” This is never a pretty chart, as much as we’d like to imagine cardioid microphones are really cardioid. As ugly as it is, this chart (left) is about as good as it gets in vocal microphones.  With as little as 15dB of off-axis rejection in the upper-range and 50-150Hz and as much as 20-30dB in the upper mid-range to 10kHz, the RE-18 is a very directional microphone. There is no specification for shock-isolation, but the RE-18 is multiply rubber-mounted from case: everything from the step-up transformer to the element are shock-mounted and handling noise is all but non-existent.\n\nIf you would like a general description of the RE-18, S.O. Coutant does a fine job on his excellent microphones website: http://www.coutant.org/evre18/index.html. However, the best sonic description I can provide is “clarity.” Voices through the RE-18 cut through the mix without equalization or a particularly high level. Like the condenser hand-helds, the RE-18 does not provide the low-mid honk of the SM-58 and that is what many live engineers have come to describe as “presence” on their way to hearing impairment."

    "text": "Before the advent of refrigeration and the year round production of vegetables, the Koreans relied on preserving 김 치 to make through winter months.\nFound a photo of mom, along with her neighbors, making 김치 that will last all of winter.\n\n\n\nEarly 70s in 주안. Mother and her helper making 김치\n\n\nThe process began with selecting cabbages from wholesalers.\nAt the time, we lived in 주안 and the supplies for 김치 was not fully available. Mom arranged 배추 to be delivered to the home.\nThen cabbages would be delivered using 리어카(RearCar/リヤカー).\n[I followed the older man, (he looked old, but was not even 50) delivering cabbages home. Pushing the cart on the uphill. It was about a 5km journey, according to Google map, but for a young person, it seemed much longer.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI estimate scores of cabbages, approaching 100 were purchased and delivered.\n[It is possible, 김치 was made and divided among families]\nMy mom would orchestrate the production of 김치.\nWe shared a common wall with the elementary school. Between the wall was a space, with a protective awning of transparent plastic. My dad or his younger brother, who was living with us, must have dug a hole in the ground for the 항아리 to be buried.\n\nan earthenware vessel with a narrow top and bottom and a bulging middle, used for storing and preserving items\n\nThese were good sized potteries. About 3 feet high with a 3 feet diameter at its peak width. (The actual size may have been smaller, everything seemed bigger when you were young)\n\n\n\nSpring 1999, 장독 with 항아리, 뱀밭, near 현충사\n\n\nI recall breaking ice to access cabbages and radishes during winter months.\nThese provide nourishment we needed during those months when no fresh vegetables were available.\nI remember the crisp, naturally preserved, flavor of radishes. Mom would slice them into size of thin french fries and and bit of vinegar and red pepper.\nThat was how we survived long winter months during growing up years in 인천.\n\nFull Definition of 김장 from NamuWiki\n겨울 동안 먹을 다량의 김치를 늦가을이나 초겨울에 담그는 행위 또는 그렇게 담근 김치를 일컫는 말. 주로 11월이나 12월에 김장을 한다.^[https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B9%80%EC%9E%A5]\nThe act of making a large quantity of kimchi during late autumn or early winter to be consumed throughout the winter, or the kimchi made in this way. Kimjang is typically done in November or December."

    "text": "Life is a race to appreciate, learn and implement guiding truths.\nOne of the truths that needs to be understood is,\n\nHow awe inspiring our parents are.\n\nWhile they are with us, we seldom express appreciation for their presence.\nWe pay attention to what others are doing, what is happening at work, happening in the world.\nWe are focused on what is important to us.\nThings outside of our core lives.\n\nFor our parents, we were always the center of their concerns.\nWhen they are no longer with us, we miss their wisdom and love, and their being.\nAt some point in our lives, we transform.\nFrom a receiver to a giver.\nNo longer interested in drawing attention to ourselves but to an understanding, lifting, and healing role. From an ambitious person to an appreciative person.\nIn short, we take place of our parents.\n\n\nRecall a children story\n청개구리 (young blue frog)\nThere was a young frog that disobeyed his mother.  In fact, he did opposite of what was asked of him.  His wayward ways affected his mom and her health deteriorated.\nAs a last wish, she asked him to bury her near the river.\nThinking that he would disobey and bury her in the mountain, away from the flooding river.\nAt last, the son reconsidered and followed mother’s wish and she was buried by the river.\nTill this day, young frogs, cries (croaks) when the weather turns foul, worried that the grave would be washed away.\nLINK to a full story\n\nDuring the summer of 2023, a memorial was held for a pioneering Korean member.\nMarking the 20 years since his passing.\nHis only son was conducting the meeting.\nAs he began, he dispelled a thought some of us had,\n\nThis is not some reincarnation, I am the son.\n\nBut for us who knew the father, the son looked and sounded like his father.\n\nI started to look like my father about 2 decades ago, with some features, influenced by my mother.\nMoreover, people begin to look and behave like their parents, because they have shared in life’s journey and experienced common events that pulls them together.\nThat life is mostly cloudy, with threats of storm, and few intermingled calm, sunny days.\nWith hint of hopes of spring, a harvest of autumn, but mostly filled with a summer of toil and loneliness of winter.\n\n\n\nEarly 70s\n\n\n\nI don’t know how many times my parents failed in their lifetime.\nI do know they continued after setbacks.\nBecause of those challenges in life, they knew how to handle tough situations with wisdom.\nIn addition, throughout their life on this earth, my parents demonstrated this passage,\n\n“He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”\n\nThey were the rock, a foundation that we can build on.\n\nTheir lessons on life are meaningful and memorable because they lived it and lived through it.\nTheir stories of the war, poverty, and re-starting, multiple times, seemed like a distant, borrowed story.\nNo longer.\nI am grateful that I parents that loved me abundantly and showed it.\nI have learned from them.\nI appreciate, all of their sacrifice and love.\nNow it is time to reciprocate their love by remembering who they are and what they stood for.\nImplementing their teachings in my life.\nDecember 2024\n\n\n\n자유공원,自由公園"

He was an audiophile\nyour pronunciation is way too high, please speak with a lower tone. A driver taking me to 桃園市.\nwe don’t leave this open air zoo, because this is where our lives are sustained.\n\nThe last comment was made by a driver at a city-state nation.\nA nation with 4 official languages, and English, was one of them.\nAs I recall, the way he said it, it was more of resignation rather than appreciation.\nWondered over the years what that driver meant by open-air zoo and why he chose to stay, if he felt that his freedom was limited.\n\nOver the years at work, I tracked advance of others and envied the size and location of certain people’s office or cubicles.\n[This method of accommodations could be the most efficient method of housing workers or in-humane, depending on one’s perspective.]\nOver the years, of serving the sentence of working years, I am not able to determine the relationship between office or a cubicle size and surviving memories.\nI do remember people, time and places, when I left my cubicle and wandered around to see how people were doing. At times we’d talk about the projects or issues. More often we talked about the family, our dreams, and places we have visited or want to visit\nThat Taxi Driver, had an option to stay and grow or go elsewhere and start over,\n\n“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”\n\n\nViktor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning\n\nThere are many types of open air zoos.\nSociety imposed and mandated.\nOr self imposed or self limiting boundaries, some are physical but some are invisible yet exist still.\nI have lived in a society, for all of my life, that is considered to be free and open\nHowever, at times I created unseen, undetected, entrapment of the soul.\nI set those limits and boundaries.\n\n“Man’s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium.”\n\n\nViktor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning\n\n\nNot only AI Drivers and AI Agents but also mentors, colleagues, teachers and professors, doctors and nurses – Thank you.\nFor showing me how to be responsible and accountable, steps I can take to be more open and free.\nSpiritual leader, friends and family members, thank you for how to overcome challenges and tensions in this life and live towards eternal life.\n\n\n\nUtah 湖, 21 December 2024"

Through regimented error correction, both AI systems and humans will learn and improve over time.\nThe transition to self-awareness and self-correcting is the vital difference.\nToday, and in the future, there is worry about AI in music and elsewhere where creativity and individuality is crucial.\nNot worried as long as we have brave souls that create songs and those who cover those songs.\nMistake and all.\nPerhaps equally important, audience that recognize errors yet embrace it.\nIn musical performance, as well as in their own lives."

My favorite nearly-non-existent specification is “off-axis reponse.” This is never a pretty chart, as much as we’d like to imagine cardioid microphones are really cardioid. As ugly as it is, this chart (left) is about as good as it gets in vocal microphones.  With as little as 15dB of off-axis rejection in the upper-range and 50-150Hz and as much as 20-30dB in the upper mid-range to 10kHz, the RE-18 is a very directional microphone. There is no specification for shock-isolation, but the RE-18 is multiply rubber-mounted from case: everything from the step-up transformer to the element are shock-mounted and handling noise is all but non-existent.\n\nIf you would like a general description of the RE-18, S.O. Coutant does a fine job on his excellent microphones website: http://www.coutant.org/evre18/index.html. However, the best sonic description I can provide is “clarity.” Voices through the RE-18 cut through the mix without equalization or a particularly high level. Like the condenser hand-helds, the RE-18 does not provide the low-mid honk of the SM-58 and that is what many live engineers have come to describe as “presence” on their way to hearing impairment."

    "text": "Addresses in Asia\nIn the East, the addresses go from largest to smallest. For example, in Japan,\n\n…address format typically starts with the postal code, followed by the prefecture, city/ward, subarea, block number, house number, and finally the recipient’s name, with the order written from largest to smallest unit,\n\nHowever,\n\n…when written in English, the order is reversed, putting the recipient’s name first and the postal code last4\n\n\nOn prior business visits to Japan, I would have been lost and useless in Japan without a local guide.\nBecause,\n\nIs it possible to get lost in Japan? YES\nCan you get lost in Japan as a monitored, escorted visitor? NO, the receiving party will not let that happen.\n\nThose were the days without cell phones or internet on-demand.\nLuckily, people either flew to the airport of our arrival or met us at the airport.\nTo guide us to our hotels or place of business.\nOne fellow employee in Japan, S 先生, flew from Tokyo/Haneda to Ishikawa/Komatsu. Met us at the airport and accompanied us to Kanazawa.\nI was duly impressed.\nH 先生 would met us at the Narita Airport with our train tickets and take us to the hotel.\nFollowing morning, he would meet us for a breakfast, followed by a 2 hour train ride on Hikari.\nHe did this for 3 consecutive visits. Later we found out the airport was nearly 2 hours from his home in the northern, suburban Tokyo.\nHe finally, relented and let us navigate on our own.\nWithout the help of the natural landmarks, and not familiar with man-made guiding markers, we promptly boarded the local-train heading in the opposite direction.\nEver since, taking that Tokaido Main Line (東海道本線) towards the Toyohashi (豊橋駅) rather than towards the East, in the Kakegawa (掛川駅) direction, we would chuckle but we would not make the same mistakes again.\n\nNow days, it is rare for one to be completely without navigational reckoning tools.\nWe have trust in the offering and the results provide sufficient proof that the satellite images and digital rendering is both accurate and effective."

    "text": "Tools employed to guide us through this life\nAccording to ChatGPT,\n\nPersonal Values and Beliefs\nReligion and Spirituality\nIntuition and Emotions\nSocial and Cultural Influences\nRational Analysis and Logic\nGoals and Aspirations\nExternal Resources\n\nI have relied on combination of Social and Cultural Influences, specifically Family and Community and Cultural Norms, along with Religion and Spirituality, Faith-Based Guidance.\nWith the departure of my parents and Sister K’s parents, we feel somewhat lost when we are faced with the on-going as well as the new-for-us challenges arise.\n\nWhat is our North Star?\nWhat is to replace technology and artificial intelligence?\nWho do we turn to when our knowledge fails?\n\n\nGrateful to have guides and persons that are posted at locations and in crucial times.\nLike at a large, unfamiliar train stations or a new attraction that caters to a night time visit.\nMy hope is that I will venture far enough to see new things but not too far that I cannot find my way home, as my Grandma K said not too long ago.\n\n\nA Japanese address format typically starts with the postal code, followed by the prefecture, city/ward, subarea, block number, house number, and finally the recipient’s name, with the order written from largest to smallest unit, meaning the prefecture comes before the city and the city before the street level details; when written in English, the order is reversed, putting the recipient’s name first and the postal code last. \nKey points about a Japanese address:\n\nPostal code: A 7-digit code, often preceded by the symbol “〒”. \nPrefecture: The administrative region, like “Tokyo-to” (Tokyo prefecture). \nCity/Ward: The city or ward within the prefecture, like “Chiyoda-ku” (Chiyoda ward). \nSubarea: A smaller district within the city, often not directly translated to “street” in English. \nBlock number: Designated as “chōme”. \nHouse number: Designated as “ban”. \n\nExample:\n\nJapanese: 〒100-0004 東京都千代田区丸の内２丁目７番１号\nEnglish: 7-1, Marunouchi 2-Chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0004 \n\nImportant points to remember:\n\nWhen writing a Japanese address in English, the order is reversed compared to the Japanese writing style. \nJapanese streets often don’t have names, instead relying on block numbers and subareas. \nThe recipient’s name is always written last in a Japanese address. \n\n\nPeople’s decision-making in life is often guided by a combination of factors, shaped by personal, cultural, and situational influences. Here are some of the most common guides people rely on:"

    "text": "Life’s Guides\n\n1. Personal Values and Beliefs\n\nCore Values: Many individuals make decisions based on principles like honesty, loyalty, compassion, or ambition. These values are often shaped by upbringing, education, and life experiences.\nEthics and Morality: Decisions can also be guided by a sense of what is right or wrong, influenced by philosophical, cultural, or religious teachings.\n\n\n\n\n2. Religion and Spirituality\n\nFaith-Based Guidance: Religious doctrines or spiritual practices often provide frameworks for life choices, offering clarity on purpose, relationships, and priorities.\nExamples: Christians might rely on biblical teachings, while Buddhists may follow principles like mindfulness and compassion.\n\n\n\n\n3. Intuition and Emotions\n\nGut Feelings: Many people trust their instincts or emotional responses to guide decisions, especially when rational analysis is unclear or incomplete.\nEmotional Fulfillment: Choices are often aligned with what brings happiness, peace, or personal satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n4. Social and Cultural Influences\n\nFamily and Community: Decisions can be influenced by advice or expectations from family members, peers, or mentors.\nCultural Norms: Societal standards and traditions can play a significant role, particularly in collectivist cultures where group harmony is emphasized.\n\n\n\n\n5. Rational Analysis and Logic\n\nPros and Cons: Logical evaluation of options based on benefits, risks, and outcomes is a common approach for major decisions.\nData-Driven Choices: In areas like finance or career, individuals often rely on research and evidence to guide their paths.\n\n\n\n\n6. Goals and Aspirations\n\nShort-Term vs. Long-Term Goals: Decision-making can be influenced by how choices align with personal or professional objectives.\nSelf-Improvement: Many decisions are guided by the desire for growth, success, or achieving a specific vision of life.\n\n\n\n\n7. External Resources\n\nExperts and Professionals: Consulting with therapists, financial advisors, or career counselors can provide clarity.\nBooks and Media: Self-help literature, podcasts, or motivational speakers can inspire and guide life decisions.\n\nEach person blends these factors differently based on their unique circumstances, making decision-making a deeply personal process."

A black rotary phone with 5 digits, 1 for the station and a 4-digit private number.\nWe also got a black piano finish entertainment set. It played vinyls or records and radio stations.\nThen we got a B&W TV Set. Only a few stations, including the AFKN (American Forces Korean Network) Network.\nMy recollection of those years is, life was void of colors, and it was always cold, since we walked to most places.\nLife was bit dreary and B&W was the correct medium.\nAt a recent dinner, with a Korean couple, we were trying to state who had a tougher life as a child in Korea.\nA game of who walked further to school in snow.\nWhen I said, we were poor and we only had running indoor plumbing but no indoor toilet.\nThe guest mentioned, indoor plumbing would have been a luxury item, in the village where he grew up."

    "text": "3 Decisions in Life\nGrowing up my mother mentioned, a number of times, that her family has practiced medicine - both western and eastern. Without saying directly, she was encouraging me to continue that tradition.\nI could not envision myself as a doctor and I never considered it. Reasoned that in the future, technology would pervade society. Following my sister’s lead1, I chose to study Engineering.\n\nSimilarly my parents didn’t say or give directions on dating and marriage, directly. Their marriage was an arranged marriage. Perhaps it was their response or reaction to past generations’ effort to arrange marriages. Or they were unfamiliar with the new way of courtship.\nHowever when I started dating Korean persons after the mission, they expressed their approval. The challenge became, finding that person of similar heritage that shared the same spiritual direction. There were not that many Koreans that belonged to the church.\n\nThe decision on the spiritual direction was made for me by my parents.\nFrom the earliest days, and it was always cold in those days, we would attend church meetings. I remember walking to 화랑 고회 at night and could hear the animal sound in the distant.\nIt was 장로교회 until missionaries came. Then at age of 8.5 I was baptized along with my siters and my mother.2\nI didn’t question the church or the gospel growing up. I did have a period where I was questioning myself,\nWho am I? What is my purpose in life?\nI am grateful that my parents had the love and patience to help me through this stage."

    "text": "First few years of Transition\nFiguring out the church schedule was a challenge, since we couldn’t understand the announcement. We missed our share of meetings due to Stake and General Conferences and missed the starting time, due to not understanding the Daylight Savings Time.\nOur language improved and Brother Bacon from Terre Haute, IN became our Home Teacher. For the next 5 years, he faithfully visited our home. We became more involved in the Ward\nNot always, but attended the weeknight meetings as well.\nThat led to participating in Road Shows, summer camps and a church wide celebration. Summer camps and Father and Sons campout were those rare occasions to see places other than a cityscape/\nThe Sesquicentennial celebration in Roanoke and the surrounding area in 1980 was a defining event for a young person.\nThe magnitude of participation, from the mid-atlantic areas, as well as the depth of commitment demonstrated by participants made a deep impression.\nThe Ferrum College and the surrounding areas of Roanoke Conference Center opened up a new chapter for a young immigrant person.\n—\nWe attended church in Korea after the War. For adults, it was a religion. For a young person, it was a chore to walk to and from church often at night Hearing wild animals added to the sense of sacrifice and an adventure.\nSnacks or treats offered during Easters and Christmas were definitely highlights.\nThen our family, mainly through my mother’s conversion, joined another congregation. It was not a popular choice then. But my mother was convinced that it was the right choice for her and the family.\nWithin 3 years, we were boarding a plane headed for Anchorage. On our way to a new home in the Washington DC area.\nParticularly memorable gatherings were at Christmas time.\nWas asked to learn Christmas Carol to be sung at the Church. Participated in Christmas Devotional at the Church. My father became one of the Wisemen at a church play.\nRecall a Christmas Eve gathering at a home, where people are invited to visit, stay or go according to their schedule. Plenty of goodies were served. Remember thinking, when I have a chance, I want to have a gathering like this.\nThis and many other gatherings helped me realize what a family centered, community assisted living was like.\nAccording to Ephesians,\n\n19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;\n\nWords when words cannot be found Hope when things looked bleak\nNow that you are on the other side. Could you be that force that helps us.\nHelp us to be wise when we don’t know\n\n“When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence.” Ansel Adams\n\nThe silence, often of pure innocence, persuades where speaking fails. Shakespeare\nA sage thing is timely silence, and better than any speech.\nPlutarch\n\n“在宁静中，我们才能聆听自己的内心声音。” - 未知\n“安静是一种力量，使我们能够更清晰地思考和感知。” - 未知\n“有时，安静比言语更能表达深刻的思考和情感。” - 未知\n“安静是创造和平的土壤，让心灵得以宁静。” - 未知\n“在安静中，我们发现内在的平静，这是真正的富足。” - 未知\n“不是所有的东西都需要言说，有时安静本身就是一种回应。” - 未知\n“在安静的瞬间，我们找到了与自己对话的机会。” - 未知\n“安静并不意味着无聊，而是一段与自己对话的宝贵时光。” - 未知\n“安静是心灵的庇护所，在那里我们能够找到平静和力量。” - 未知\n“当世界嘈杂时，安静是我们的庇护，让我们重新连接内心。” - 未知\n“In silence, we can listen to our inner voice.” - Unknown\n“Quietness is a strength that enables us to think and feel more clearly.” - Unknown\n“Sometimes silence can express deeper thoughts and emotions better than words can.” - Unknown\n“Quietness is the soil that creates peace and allows the mind to be at peace.” - Unknown\n“In silence we find inner peace, which is true abundance.” - Unknown\n“Not everything needs words, sometimes silence itself is a response.” - Unknown\n“In quiet moments we find the opportunity to talk to ourselves.” - Unknown\n“Quiet time does not mean boredom, but a precious time to talk to yourself.” - Unknown\n“Quietness is the sanctuary of the soul, where we can find peace and strength.” - Unknown\n“When the world is noisy, silence is our refuge and allows us to reconnect with our hearts.” - Unknown\n\n가사 남들도 모르게 서성이다 울었지 지나온 일들이 가슴에 사무쳐 텅빈 하늘 밑 불빛들 켜져가면 옛사랑 그 이름 아껴 불러보네 찬바람 불어와 옷깃을 여미우다 후회가 또 화가 나 눈물이 흐르네 누가 물어도 아플 것같지 않던 지나온 내 모습 모두 거짓인가\n이제 그리운 것은 그리운대로 내 맘에 둘 거야 그대 생각이 나면 생각난대로 내버려 두듯이\n흰눈 나리면 들판에 서성이다 옛사랑 생각에 그 길 찾아가지 광화문거리 흰눈에 덮혀가고 하얀눈 하늘 높이 자꾸 올라가네\n이제 그리운 것은 그리운대로 내 맘에 둘 거야 그대 생각이 나면 생각난대로 내버려 두듯이\n사랑이란 게 지겨울 때가 있지 내 맘에 고독이 너무 흘러넘쳐 눈 녹은 봄날 푸르른 잎새 위에 옛사랑 그대 모습 영원 속에 있네\n흰눈 나리면 들판에 서성이다 옛사랑 생각에 그 길 찾아가지 광화문거리 흰눈에 덮혀가고 하얀눈 하늘높이 자꾸 올라가네\nI cried while wandering around without others noticing. Things that have happened are deep in my heart When the lights turn on under the empty sky I call out the name of my old love with care A cold wind blows and frays my collar. I feel regretful and angry again, tears are flowing. It didn’t seem like it would hurt no matter who asked Are all of my past lies a lie?\nNow, I will keep the things I miss in my heart as I miss them. When I think of you, I leave it alone\nWhen white snow falls, I wander in the fields. I think about my old love and find that path. Gwanghwamun Street is covered in white snow The white snow keeps rising high into the sky\nNow, I will keep the things I miss in my heart as I miss them. When I think of you, I leave it alone\nThere are times when love is boring My heart is overflowing with loneliness On the green leaves of a spring day when the snow melts Old love, you are in eternity\nWhen white snow falls, I wander in the fields. I think about my old love and find that path. Gwanghwamun Street is covered in white snow The white snow keeps rising high into the sky\nHere is the English translation of the Korean lyrics:\nWithout others knowing, I lingered and cried The past events haunt my heart Under the empty sky, as the lights come on I call the name of the old love, cherishing it The cold wind blows, brushing against my clothes Regret rises again, anger surfaces, and tears flow No matter who asks, it didn’t seem painful Is the person I used to be all a lie?\nNow, what I miss will remain in my heart as it is When thoughts of you come, I’ll let them be as they come\nIf it snows, I wander in the field Thinking of the old love, finding that path Gwanghwamun Street covered in white snow The white snow keeps rising high into the sky\nNow, what I miss will remain in my heart as it is When thoughts of you come, I’ll let them be as they come\nLove can be tiresome at times Loneliness overflows in my heart On a spring day with melted snow, on fresh green leaves The figure of the old love remains eternally\nIf it snows, I wander in the field Thinking of the old love, finding that path Gwanghwamun Street covered in white snow The white snow keeps rising high into the sky"

For us, hills and trees looked similar, but not for her. They provided a unique and a familiar way for her to navigate back and forth to her destinations."

YES\nCan you get lost in Japan as a monitored, escorted visitor? NO, the receiving party will not let that happen.\n\nThose were the days without cell phones or internet on-demand.\nLuckily, people either flew to the airport of our arrival or met us at the airport.\nTo guide us to our hotels or place of business.\nOne fellow employee in Japan, S 先生, flew from Tokyo/Haneda to Ishikawa/Komatsu. Met us at the airport and accompanied us to Kanazawa.\nI was duly impressed.\nH 先生 would met us at the Narita Airport with our train tickets and take us to the hotel.\nFollowing morning, he would meet us for a breakfast, followed by a 2 hour train ride on Hikari.\nHe did this for 3 consecutive visits. Later we found out the airport was nearly 2 hours from his home in the northern, suburban Tokyo.\nHe finally, relented and let us navigate on our own.\nWithout the help of the natural landmarks, and not familiar with man-made guiding markers, we promptly boarded the local-train heading in the opposite direction.\nEver since, taking that Tokaido Main Line (東海道本線) towards the Toyohashi (豊橋駅) rather than towards the East, in the Kakegawa (掛川駅) direction, we would chuckle but we would not make the same mistakes again.\n\nNow days, it is rare for one to be completely without navigational reckoning tools.\nWe have trust in the offering and the results provide sufficient proof that the satellite images and digital rendering is both accurate and effective."

    "text": "Life’s Guides\n\n1. Personal Values and Beliefs\n\nCore Values: Many individuals make decisions based on principles like honesty, loyalty, compassion, or ambition. These values are often shaped by upbringing, education, and life experiences.\nEthics and Morality: Decisions can also be guided by a sense of what is right or wrong, influenced by philosophical, cultural, or religious teachings.\n\n\n\n\n2. Religion and Spirituality\n\nFaith-Based Guidance: Religious doctrines or spiritual practices often provide frameworks for life choices, offering clarity on purpose, relationships, and priorities.\nExamples: Christians might rely on biblical teachings, while Buddhists may follow principles like mindfulness and compassion.\n\n\n\n\n3. Intuition and Emotions\n\nGut Feelings: Many people trust their instincts or emotional responses to guide decisions, especially when rational analysis is unclear or incomplete.\nEmotional Fulfillment: Choices are often aligned with what brings happiness, peace, or personal satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n4. Social and Cultural Influences\n\nFamily and Community: Decisions can be influenced by advice or expectations from family members, peers, or mentors.\nCultural Norms: Societal standards and traditions can play a significant role, particularly in collectivist cultures where group harmony is emphasized.\n\n\n\n\n5. Rational Analysis and Logic\n\nPros and Cons: Logical evaluation of options based on benefits, risks, and outcomes is a common approach for major decisions.\nData-Driven Choices: In areas like finance or career, individuals often rely on research and evidence to guide their paths.\n\n\n\n\n6. Goals and Aspirations\n\nShort-Term vs. Long-Term Goals: Decision-making can be influenced by how choices align with personal or professional objectives.\nSelf-Improvement: Many decisions are guided by the desire for growth, success, or achieving a specific vision of life.\n\n\n\n\n7. External Resources\n\nExperts and Professionals: Consulting with therapists, financial advisors, or career counselors can provide clarity.\nBooks and Media: Self-help literature, podcasts, or motivational speakers can inspire and guide life decisions.\n\nEach person blends these factors differently based on their unique circumstances, making decision-making a deeply personal process."

He learns that immortality is unattainable for humans and that one should focus on the legacy they leave behind, rather than fearing death. This teaches us about accepting mortality and finding meaning in life itself.\nFriendship and Compassion: The deep bond between Gilgamesh and Enkidu shows the power of friendship to change and improve individuals. Gilgamesh’s transformation after Enkidu’s death highlights how relationships shape our character and understanding of the world.\nThe Limits of Power: As a king, Gilgamesh starts as a tyrant, but through his trials, he realizes that power alone cannot fulfill one’s life. His growth into a wise and just ruler underscores the value of humility and self-awareness.\nThe Inevitability of Suffering: Both Gilgamesh and Enkidu face loss, hardship, and grief, showing that suffering is an inescapable part of life. How one responds to it defines their character.\nHuman Connection to Nature: Enkidu, initially a wild man, represents the balance between civilization and nature. His journey and eventual domestication reflect the importance of respecting the natural world and finding harmony between human society and the environment.\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh offers timeless wisdom about human nature, life, and death."

Determined to escape death, he embarks on a quest to find Utnapishtim, a man who was granted immortality by the gods after surviving a great flood.\nWhen Gilgamesh finally meets Utnapishtim, he learns that immortality is a gift that cannot be achieved by effort or desire, but is given by the gods under special circumstances. Utnapishtim recounts how he and his wife were made immortal as a reward for preserving life during the flood, but tells Gilgamesh that this fate is not for everyone.\nUtnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights to prove his worthiness, but Gilgamesh fails. He is then told about a plant that can restore youth, which Gilgamesh retrieves, but it is stolen by a snake while he bathes, leaving him with nothing.\nIn the end, Gilgamesh returns to his city of Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond human reach. Instead, he learns that his true legacy lies in the achievements of his life, particularly in the enduring works he builds for his people, such as the city’s walls. The narrative teaches that while physical immortality is unattainable, one can achieve a form of immortality through their deeds and contributions to society."

    "section": "Layout and Patterns of Buddhist Temples",
    "text": "Layout and Patterns of Buddhist Temples\nThe layout and pattern of Buddhist temples vary by region, but there are common elements and principles rooted in Buddhist cosmology, spiritual practice, and local architectural traditions. Here’s a general overview of the typical layout and structure of a Buddhist temple:\n\n1. Orientation\n\nCardinal Directions: Temples are often aligned with cardinal directions, especially facing east, symbolizing the Buddha’s enlightenment and the rising sun.\nSymmetry: Temples often follow a symmetrical layout, reflecting balance and harmony, which are key principles in Buddhism.\n\n\n\n2. Main Components of a Buddhist Temple\n\n2.1 Entrance (Torana or Gate)\n\nThe entrance to a Buddhist temple is usually marked by a gate or torana, often elaborately decorated. It signifies the passage from the secular world to the sacred.\n\n\n\n2.2 Stupa (Pagoda in East Asia)\n\nStupas are dome-like structures that hold relics, usually of the Buddha or other important monks. They are central features of many Buddhist temples.\nThe stupa represents the mind of the Buddha and the universe, symbolizing enlightenment. It is often surrounded by circumambulation paths, where devotees walk in a clockwise direction as a form of meditation or prayer.\n\n\n\n2.3 Main Hall (Vihara, Wat, or Daibutsuden)\n\nThe main hall houses statues of the Buddha and is the primary place of worship.\nIt may include:\n\nSeated Buddha statue: Symbolizing meditation and enlightenment.\nStanding Buddha statue: Representing the Buddha’s teachings and blessing.\nReclining Buddha statue: Symbolizing the Buddha’s passing into nirvana.\n\nIn many East Asian temples, the main hall is called the Daibutsuden (Great Buddha Hall) or Main Shrine Hall.\n\n\n\n2.4 Meditation Halls (Zendo or Dhyana Hall)\n\nTemples often include a meditation hall, where monks and practitioners engage in meditation practices.\nThe layout is simple and serene to promote focus.\n\n\n\n2.5 Monastic Quarters (Vihara)\n\nBuddhist temples often include monastic living quarters for monks and nuns, usually located near or within the temple complex.\n\n\n\n2.6 Prayer Wheels or Prayer Flags (Tibetan Temples)\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhist temples, you might find prayer wheels filled with mantras or prayer flags flying in the wind. These symbolize the spreading of good karma and blessings.\n\n\n\n2.7 Courtyard\n\nMany temples have open courtyards that provide a serene space for contemplation. Courtyards often contain gardens, trees, and sometimes ponds, reflecting the natural world and the impermanence of life.\n\n\n\n\n3. Architectural Style Variations\n\nIndian Subcontinent: Simple, rock-cut caves like those found in Ajanta or Ellora; stupas like the Great Stupa at Sanchi.\nSoutheast Asia: Tiered roofs, vibrant colors, and spires are common in temples like Thailand’s Wat Phra Kaew or Myanmar’s Shwedagon Pagoda.\nChina and Japan: Wooden pagodas with sloping roofs, such as Todaiji in Japan or Leshan Giant Buddha in China.\nTibet: Thick walls, golden roofs, prayer wheels, and intricate murals, as seen in the Potala Palace or Jokhang Temple.\n\n\n\n4. Symbolism in the Design\n\nStupa Structure: The stupa is usually designed to represent the elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, culminating in a central point symbolizing nirvana.\nLotus Motif: The lotus flower, representing purity and enlightenment, is commonly depicted in temple architecture.\nMandala Layout: Some temples are laid out in the pattern of a mandala, a spiritual symbol representing the universe in Hindu and Buddhist traditions.\n\nWould you like to learn more about a specific temple or region?"

Thank you.\nLast weekend, my husband and I had the opportunity to attend a stake conference in Tokyo we also had the opportunity to visit three sisters and their families.\ncoincidentally, all three sisters were terminally ill. But, while visiting, I saw that the sisters understood Heavenly Father’s perfect plan of salvation and endured this hardship with faith in power, so I was so touched to see them so joyfully.\none of the sisters had cancer cells that had spread throughout her body, and the doctor said that there was nothing more she could do, so she had only about two months to live.\nSo we visited her. So now, I think she was so tired that she couldn’t even come to see us. I was worried about what to do if it was hard, so I went in the door, but that sister was smiling so brightly and saying that it was dinner time in the kitchen, so she was diligently and happily preparing food for us.\nAs I looked at the sister, she said that of course she was physically and mentally tired, but she was thinking about how she could serve and help others in this situation.\nShe said that her husband was in charge of the missionary work, and that her husband helped her diligently, and that two baptisms had come out recently.\nShe said that she was so happy because she was living in joy, and she felt that her body was becoming more energetic and better. When I saw that sister, who was really struggling, did not get frustrated by her own difficulties, but instead reached out to others,\nI thought that she was a person who really resembled the Lord. At the general conference last October, I would like to share a word that Elder Quentin Cook said.\nIt was one of my favorite tables. It was about following Christ in peace. He spoke about where it is possible to be, and he said this: We do not know all the answers to what happens in life, but we do know important principles that will help us face realization, hardship, and adversity with faith and confidence in the bright future that awaits each of us.\nI testify that those who follow Christ in peace will find personal peace both in this life and in our glorious reunion in heaven. I was strengthened by the words of the State of the Union.\nI testify that even in this climate, when we look to Jesus Christ and focus on the peace and healing He offers, all the difficulties and hardships we face can be transformed into joy and hope. I testify that our Heavenly Father knows and loves us all, and that Jesus is my Redeemer and Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n먼저 이렇게 여러분들에게 제 간증을 전할 수 있는 길를 주시는 Cook 장로님께 감사를 드립니다\n아 얼마 전에 한한 2주 전에 그 저희 자녀 중에 한 명이 저에게 어\n아버지 아버지는 이제이 새로운 부름을 받고 봉사하시는 지난 몇 개월간\n무엇을 배 배웠습니까고 저한테 물어보더라고요 그 제가 곰곰히 생각을\n볼 수 있는 기회가 있었습니다 과연 지난 몇 달간 제가이 새로운 부름에서 봉사하면서 과연 나는 을 배웠는가\n그때 생각났던 바로 구절이 바로 그 니파의 후서 여러분 잘 아시는 4장\n3절의 말씀입니다 제가 이제 살아계신 선지자 선견자 계시자 이제 제 회당\n당과 그리고 또 오늘 저희들과 함께하고 계시는 우리 쿡 장로님이 비롯해서 어 12사도 정원의 어 우리\n사도님 그리고 시민 정원의 회장님 회장당선 있는 총관리 군들의 모습들을\n바라보면서 그분들이 매일매일 그리고 그 시간시간 그 때 그때마다 그분들이 얼마나이\n34절에 바로 그 고대의 몰의 예언자였던 선지자였던 니파이가\n저들에게 주해 주신 그분의 마음을 제가 배울 수가 있었습니다 34절에\n그분은 저희들에게 주여 내가 주를 의뢰 하였사오니 내가 또\n영원히 주를 의뢰하다 내가 육신의 팔에 나의\n신뢰를 두지 아니하리니 이는 육신의에 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자가 저주를 받는 줄 내가 니이다\n참으로 사람에게 자기의 신뢰를 두는 자 육신으로 자기의 팔을 삼는 자는\n저주를 받았나이다이 주님의 종들은 매시간\n시간 매 때마다 그분들은 인간의 팔에 의지하지 않고 고린 가지고 있는 그런\n개인 념이 생이나에 의지지 않고 항상\n주님께 의지하며 주님을 신뢰하며 그분께 그분의 도움을 구하는 모습들을 저는\n지켜보았습니다이 세상에 그 많은 것들이 저희들에게이 세상의 것에이\n사람의 팔에 의지하라고 저희들에게 가르치지만 저희들이 주님께 저의 마음을 돌리고 그분께 신라고 그분을\n신뢰하고 그분의 팔에 의지할 때 참으로 저희들이이 세상이 끝나고 후에도 영원히 오는이 세상에서 저들이\n그분의 축복을 받은 사실 간증 드리면서 여러분들의 수고와 여러분들 신앙 사심에 큰 감사를 드리면서\n여러분이 지치 하식 소망하겠습니다 예수님은 우리들의 그리스도이시며\n저희들의 구세 주님께 간증드립니다 예수 그리스도의 이름으로 간증드립니다 아멘\nFirst, I would like to thank the director for giving me the opportunity to share my testimony with you all.\nAh, a couple of weeks ago, one of our children asked me,\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nI had a chance to think carefully.\nWhat have I learned in the past few months while serving in this new calling?\nThe verse that came to mind was the verse in 2 Nephi 4:3 that you all know well. I now look at the living prophet, seer, revelator, my synagogue,\nand also at Elder Cook, who is with us today, and the general officers of the 12 Apostles, and the presidents of the civic garden,\nand how much they\nhave learned every day and every hour and every moment. Nephi\ngave me a glimpse of His heart. In verse 34,\nHe said to them, Lord, I have trusted in Thee, and I will\ntrust in Thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh, for I know that cursed is he who puts his trust in flesh.\nYea, cursed is he who puts his trust in man, who makes flesh his arm.\nThese servants of the Lord, hour by hour,\nThey do not rely on the arm of man, but they do not rely on the arm of life,\nbut they always rely on the Lord, they trust in Him, they ask for His help. I have\nwatched them. There are so many things in this world that teach us to rely on the arms of men,\nbut when we turn our hearts to the Lord, and trust in Him, and rely on His arm,\nwe will truly know that they have received His blessings in this world,\neven after this world is over, and in this world to come, for eternity. As I testify, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for your hard work and your faith,\nand I hope that you will be tired. Jesus is our Christ,\nand I testify to our Savior, I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

    "section": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples",
    "text": "Gilgamesh Epic: Reference to Temples\nThe story of ark as a representation of a temple. Reed Walls is like the veil. Ark came to rest on the top of the mountain. Dimensions of arks are representing the temple.\nHighest levels of temples (ark) as the presence of God.\nMoses tried to usher the people into the presence of God\n24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.\nD&C 84\n\nRepresentations of temples are everywhere around us. But hidden from the world. For they are spirtually discerned In the Epic of Gilgamesh, Utnapishtim plays a critical role as a character who possesses the secret to immortality. His encounter with the hero, Gilgamesh, marks a pivotal moment in the story, as Gilgamesh’s quest for eternal life reaches its climax. Here’s a breakdown of Utnapishtim’s role in the epic:\n\n1. The Survivor of the Great Flood\n\nUtnapishtim is most famous for surviving a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity. His story bears significant resemblance to the biblical account of Noah’s Ark in the Book of Genesis.\nHe was warned by the god Ea (Enki) about the impending flood and instructed to build a massive boat to save himself, his family, and the animals.\nAfter the flood, Utnapishtim and his wife were granted immortality by the gods as a reward for preserving life and obeying their command.\n\n\n\n2. Symbol of Immortality\n\nGilgamesh seeks out Utnapishtim after the death of his friend Enkidu, driven by a fear of death and a desire to discover the secret of eternal life.\nUtnapishtim represents the possibility of immortality, something that Gilgamesh believes he can attain.\nHowever, Utnapishtim’s story ultimately shows that immortality is not meant for mortals. While he and his wife were granted eternal life, this was an exception and not something Gilgamesh can achieve through effort or desire.\n\n\n\n3. The Test of Endurance\n\nWhen Gilgamesh meets Utnapishtim, he pleads for the secret to eternal life. Instead of directly giving it to him, Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s endurance by challenging him to stay awake for six days and seven nights.\nGilgamesh fails the test, falling asleep almost immediately, which underscores the frailty and limitations of human beings. Utnapishtim demonstrates that if Gilgamesh cannot conquer something as simple as sleep, he is unworthy of immortality.\n\n\n\n4. The Plant of Youth\n\nDespite Gilgamesh’s failure, Utnapishtim shows some compassion and reveals the existence of a plant at the bottom of the ocean that can restore youth.\nGilgamesh successfully retrieves the plant, but on his way back to his city, a serpent steals it, and Gilgamesh loses the chance for renewed youth. This event highlights the theme of inevitable mortality and the elusiveness of eternal life.\n\n\n\n5. Philosophical Message\n\nUtnapishtim’s role is crucial in conveying one of the central themes of the Epic of Gilgamesh: the inevitability of death and the importance of living a full and meaningful life.\nHe helps Gilgamesh realize that instead of seeking immortality, he should focus on the legacy he leaves behind and the life he leads on Earth.\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Utnapishtim’s Role:\n\nSurvivor of the Flood: He provides the key mythological story about a great flood and the gods’ decision to grant him immortality.\nTest of Gilgamesh: Utnapishtim tests Gilgamesh’s ability to transcend mortal limitations, which Gilgamesh fails.\nLesson in Mortality: He teaches Gilgamesh that immortality is reserved for the gods and special circumstances, and that human beings must come to terms with death.\nConveys the Epic’s Theme: Utnapishtim helps shift Gilgamesh’s quest from a search for eternal life to a recognition of the need to live meaningfully."

which was malevolent those\n0:13\nare the options it’s like they just mean equality of opportunity it’s like then why do they have a different word they\n0:20\ndon’t mean equality of opportunity they mean equality of outcome if you’re foolish enough to believe in equality of\n0:25\noutcome then you deserve to lose the Senate lose the house and lose the\n0:31\npresidency right and that’s what happened that’s\n0:37\nthat American Dream element that that admiration for entrepreneurial\n0:43\nExcellence that while you see that manifested in someone like Elon Musk and you know two thumbs up for that as far\n0:50\nas I’m concerned and it would be lovely especially over the next four years if all you entrepreneurial types stop\n0:56\nletting the radical progressives have the moral upper hand because they for the poor it’s like no they’re not not a\n1:03\nnot even a bit all the bloody green leftists have done in Europe is doomed the poor to extensive and deteriorating\n1:10\npoverty that’s all they’ve done they haven’t cleaned up the environment one bit they would musk jump the board I\n1:16\nthought oh if musk would do something like establish a a department of\n1:21\ngovernmental efficiency I would support Trump just for that like just that but that’s not\n1:27\nall he’s got I think Gabbert is great she’s very very solid she’s the candidate the Democrats should have run\n1:33\nthis is an appalling fact if Biden would have been willing to give Trump some credit which he should have because Mr\n1:39\nTrump might have just ridden off into the sunset If he if they had been willing to give the devil is due you\n1:46\nknow he should have got the Nobel Peace Prize for those Abraham Accords if someone just meet you on an elevator and\n1:51\nsays what do you do how do you\n1:57\nrespond um I off often tell them to look up my name but to beware of doing so\n2:04\nthat’s a good answer that is a really good answer uh so what is the best thing\n2:11\nand the worst thing about being Jordan Peterson well I I suppose the worst\n2:18\nthing probably is that I can’t I’m I’m quite a lot of trouble all things considered um I’m\n2:26\ntroubled to my wife I’m troubled to me I’m troubled to be around and so maybe that’s the worst thing it’s complicated\n2:33\num the best thing is unlimited opportunity right yeah it’s\n2:39\nit’s it’s it’s absurd fundamentally that’s great it’s ridiculous it’s ridiculously great and\n2:46\nwell so I have a question here how do you decide who gets your time what gets your time how and how do you politely\n2:52\nsay no to set boundaries because it’s got to be all these opportunities there’s opportunity cost right with\n2:58\nopportunities so you have to spend that time well there there’s a variety of ways of doing that and you have to build\n3:04\nyou as your wealth of opportunities increases the infrastructure that you have around you to deal with the\n3:11\nopportunities also has to expand and so there’s a variety of ways that you\n3:17\ndecide what gets your time when you have more opportunities than you know what to do with and first thing you have to do\n3:24\nis figure out what your priorities are right so you need a vision for the future that’s welldeveloped and then you\n3:29\nhave to see if the opportunities that you’re being presented with are in keeping with what it is that you’re\n3:35\ntrying to achieve and that should be very well delineated then I have a lot\n3:42\nof people who help me with that you know I’m surrounded I wouldn’t call them Gatekeepers exactly because that’s not\n3:49\nright the right way of conceptualizing them I have a variety of people around me who help me negotiate and who\n3:56\nprioritize potential opportunities for me and there people who know why I’m\n4:01\ndoing what I’m doing and who are on board with that and so when they’re making decisions I can be confident that\n4:07\nthey’re bringing to my attention and prioritizing opportunities that further the broader Mission and then I suppose\n4:17\nthat I also use money because money is the way that we negotiate priority and\n4:23\nso and and it’s a very efficient way of doing that if I have two opportunities that look like they’re of equal value\n4:30\nwith regard to the relevance to my aims and one pays twice as much well it’s obvious which one to take and that’s\n4:37\npartly why we use money right because money is a universal representation system for value and it can’t it’s not\n4:45\nperfect because it doesn’t fully capture potential opportunity right it’s\n4:51\nlike when you’re trying to value a company you can value the company with regards to its current earnings or its\n4:56\nprofit margin but you also have to factor in growth and that’s a difficult thing to do and so if I’m trying to\n5:02\nprioritize opportunities the financial return is obviously relevant but the\n5:08\npossibility for growth coming out of the opportunity is also now that’s more\n5:13\ndifficult to quantify but that’s also why I have lots of people around me who help me with that and like I have lots of people around me who who do this for\n5:20\nme there’s probably altogether All Things Considered there’s at least 15\n5:26\npeople uh there’s probably more like 30 who are doing this for me all the time\n5:31\nand so all the opportunities that do end up on my desk so to speak have been vetted extraordinarily thoroughly and\n5:38\nthey’re almost inevitably worth further Pursuit but\n5:46\nso if you’re overwhelmed by your responsibilities and your opportunities\n5:52\npart of the reason for that is that you haven’t distributed enough responsibility to other people you\n5:58\nhaven’t set up a team that’s of sufficient quality and then you have to\n6:04\nask yourself why you know one possible reason might be that you’re\n6:10\nnot brutal enough to make the hard decisions that are necessary with\n6:16\nregards to Staffing so for example I’ve been running a tour now\n6:23\nfor8 years I guess 8 years and we’re\n6:28\nvery cutting dried with regards to our touring Staffing we have very stringent\n6:34\nrules and the one rule for example is don’t bother the people who come and see\n6:40\nme you are obligated to be 100% polite\n6:46\nto them under all circumstances all the time and that goes as well for I travel\n6:52\nwith some security guys for example and they help me with Logistics and like they have to be good to the waiters and\n6:58\nto all the service staff that we encounter like I want to travel to the places I’m going leaving nothing but a\n7:05\ngood taste behind and this is something very important to consider if you’re running any kind kind of business\n7:11\nespecially as you become more successful because if people have a certain degree\n7:16\nof admiration for you let’s say or you’re even willing to meet you halfway and then you disappoint them they will\n7:23\nnever forget that and they will tell like a thousand people and you don’t have to make many mistakes like that\n7:29\ntill gets around and things are not good and so our policy especially on the\n7:34\ntours is you don’t make mistakes if you make mistakes we you don’t come along\n7:39\nand now I shouldn’t exactly say that because people are going to make mistakes they have to fix them right I\n7:46\nmean things are going to slip a sideways from time to time but you have to fix it\n7:51\nand and you you have to treat everyone well and that’s our criteria for that\n7:57\nare very strict and stringent and that’s the case for all the Staffing and hiring decisions that we make and because of\n8:05\nthat I I’m surrounded by people that I can really trust and they have their things to do and I leave them alone so\n8:12\nthat’s another thing you know if you if you’re overwhelmed with responsibility and opportunity you got to ask yourself\n8:17\nif you’re trying to control too much and you might think well I want to pay every\n8:22\nattention to every little detail it’s like no you don’t no you don’t you want\n8:28\nto use your time which is rare so that you focus on\n8:34\nthose things that only you can do and that you do best and everything else\n8:39\nthat anyone else could do that should be distributed down to them and so and you\n8:44\ncan do that if you’re willing to be picky in your hiring and your and your\n8:51\nuh what would you say your willingness to maintain people over the long run if\n8:57\nyou’re picky in that about that then you can just distribute responsibility and the huge advantage to that is then you\n9:02\nget to focus on what you’re best at and what you find that’s most compelling and you get get to further your aims and\n9:09\nthere’s no loss in that and it also stops you from getting worn out and it stops you from getting resentful and you\n9:15\ndon’t want to get worn out because then you do stupid things and you die and you don’t want to get resentful because then\n9:21\nyou’re miserable to yourself and everyone else and so you you maximize the opportunity\n9:28\nthat’s in front of You by building an efficient infrastructure and then you shouldn’t be overworked you know you got\n9:34\nto also ask yourself if you’re overworked if that’s a reflection of egotism you know because you might there\n9:40\nmight be part of you that’s thinking well you know only I can do this it’s like there are probably some things that you’re doing that only you can do but\n9:48\nyou have to be able to maintain that sustain it across time but as I said even more\n9:53\nimportantly the probability that you’re the only person that can do absolutely everything you’re doing is very low\n10:00\nthere may be some things that you’re particularly good at you should obviously be doing almost nothing but that so on the tours for example I don’t\n10:07\ndo anything but show up I show like there’s a rule I’m to be there an hour before come hell or high water and ready\n10:15\nso I have to have a rest beforehand I don’t pay attention to flights I don’t pay attention to hotels I don’t pay\n10:20\nattention to restaurants or any any details whatsoever I have people that I\n10:27\nfollow when I’m walking through airports like all I’m doing is focusing on the tour and I suppose a subsidiary concern\n10:34\nthere is my wife because she travels with me and we have to set up the tour so that she’s also thrilled to be along\n10:42\nand thrilled matters because we’ve been trying to make this which is probably the most intense thing that I do we’ve\n10:48\nbeen trying to make this sustainable and to make it sustainable you have to not be upset\n10:53\nabout it cuz otherwise you’ll just you’ll stop doing it and so well\n11:03\nwell you handle more responsibility and Opportunity by building a more differentiated sub substructure under\n11:10\nyou and that’s the other thing that’s cool about that is there’s no limit to what you can do then right because you just keep building layers of\n11:17\ninfrastructure beneath you and if you hire properly and you’re very careful about that then you can just keep\n11:23\njumping up the ladder so to speak that’s how you’re that’s how you work neurologically by the way way when you\n11:30\npay attention to something and you practice it you build little automated structures that are neurological and\n11:35\nthen they run unconsciously and then your Consciousness jumps up a letter a level so that you can concentrate on\n11:41\nthings that haven’t yet been automatized so you’re trying to put in routines all the time underneath you so that you can\n11:47\nfree yourself up to attend to only those things that are crucial you know that if you study people too like Steve Jobs and\n11:54\nElon Musk I mean jobs in particular was absolutely I know people who’ worked with him very closely as well as musk\n12:02\njobs was unbelievably good at deciding what he wasn’t going to do right he put all his attention on the things where\n12:08\nthe maximum return would be this is something to know too even technically so you know you’ve heard about the 8020\n12:14\nrule I presumes 20% of your customers provide 80% of your business that’s not\n12:19\nthe rule the rule is way more remarkable than that so here’s the\n12:28\nrule among the people that work for you the square root of the number of people that you that work for you do half the\n12:36\nwork so that means if you have 10 employees three of them do half the work but if you have 10,000 employees a\n12:43\nhundred of them do half the work now this is an unbelievably well\n12:48\ndocumented phenomenon I’m not telling you something that’s in the realm of speculation this is a this is a solid\n12:53\nstatistical law now there’s a rule that goes along with it this and this is very\n12:58\ndifficult for managerial people to understand because they almost always do exactly the opposite spend all your time\n13:04\nwith your most productive people now the typical manager does exactly the opposite they find the 10% of their\n13:11\nstaff that are floundering and spend all their time with them I can understand why you do that\n13:17\nfrom the perspective of let’s say sympathy although it’s counterproductive you’re not going to help them you don’t\n13:23\nhave the ability you don’t have the time they don’t have the motivation it’s not going to work you spend all it’s not\n13:30\ngoing to work you can’t do it you spend all your time with your most productive people and the same with your own use of\n13:36\ntime is you spend all your time on those things that are that you are best suited to do and you have to be brutal about\n13:43\nthat and there’s nothing in that that’s anything but good because you end up\n13:49\ndoing the maximum amount of good that you can in the most sustainable way and you provide the largest possible number\n13:54\nof people with the greatest opportunity like there’s nothing in that that’s anything but good\n14:00\nand the people who are floundering you know I had a hard time in my lab when I was a\n14:06\nprofessor letting people go when I should have and I learned to do that\n14:12\nquite painfully I would say one of the things I realized and this is something to really get in your head too if you\n14:18\ncan especially if you’re a little more on the agreeable side you don’t like hurting people’s feelings enabling someone’s failure is\n14:25\nnot a moral accomplishment and so if you have someone who’s either outright\n14:30\nfailing or or Worse kind of drifting along so they’re not you know performing\n14:36\npoorly enough to really come to your attention but they’re really not all in it’s like there’s no reason not to sit\n14:43\ndown with them and say like you know you’re not thriving so what the hell are you doing\n14:50\nyou want to drag your Sor carcus through this job doing a second you know hitting\n14:56\nthis in the second rate manner for the next 15 years as you age painfully or do you want to go out and see if you can\n15:03\nfind something you could commit yourself to like this is not a game and so\n15:08\nthere’s some pain in letting people go but there’s pain in M There’s real pain\n15:14\nin maintaining people in a quasi failure situation and so it’s better just to say\n15:21\nwhy don’t you go find something you want to do and you know people don’t like change\n15:27\nand they might be all upset about the fact that that didn’t work but you lying about the fact that it’s working isn’t\n15:33\nhelping them and then you could put someone in that position who’s like pretty thrilled\n15:39\nto be there and is they’re going to devote themselves\n15:44\ncompletely to it and then you know God only knows how good that’s going to be for them and the people around them the\n15:49\nother thing other problem with having people around or doing a second rate job is that they’re really hard on the\n15:55\npeople that work for them you know they don’t know to distribute reward properly they’re\n16:00\njealous of anybody who’s working effectively they’re going to push down anyone that they see to be a threat\n16:07\nthey’re going to you know hoard information no you you just describe the\n16:12\ntypical day of most entrepreneurs yeah hey the management side is a tough one\n16:18\nyou know it’s a tough one and it’s hard to wrap your head around the balance\n16:23\nbetween separating the wheat from the chaff let’s say and being sympathetic and kind but sympathetic and kind in the\n16:31\nmoment is not a good medium to long-term strategy it’s kind of the difference on a trait level it’s the difference\n16:37\nbetween being agreeable agreeable people avoid conflict and you can understand that and\n16:44\nthey default towards sympathy and and mercy let’s say um conscientious people\n16:50\nlook at performance and agreeableness isn’t a bad ethic for within a family\n16:56\nbut conscientiousness is the ethic that works on large scale Enterprises and conscientiousness is pretty\n17:01\nstraightforward it’s like can you do the job or not and if the answer is no well then\n17:07\nyou should find a different job you know or retool your attitude that’s unlikely\n17:13\nby the way and you know the probability that you as a manager is going to are\n17:18\ngoing to get someone to shift their attitude at a fundamental level it’s pretty low like especially if they’re\n17:24\nreally in a failure pattern because you don’t even know what the hell’s going on with them and so better to pay pay\n17:31\nbetter to spend your time with your high performing people it’s a very hard thing to learn and it’s it’s cruel in a way\n17:38\nyou know it has that El element of Cruelty but not in the long run you know\n17:44\nI I have an idea though like so I’ve got you know you your first book was maps of meaning then you got 12 rules for life\n17:50\nand then beyond order but if you wanted to do a spoof book and do the complete opposite of everything he just said and\n17:55\nthen have Beyond chaos I think it would yeah bad idea bad idea yeah well I\n18:01\nthought I’ve thought about writing a book on how to fail right no I think it would be pretty funny yeah well there’s lots of ways yeah yeah yeah well what’s\n18:09\nhis name Robert Green he’s kind of done that he’s done that in some ways by laying out the P he’s laid it laid out\n18:15\nin in his books he’s laid out what would you say a description of psychopathy you\n18:20\nknow and that’s useful to know because there are psychopaths in the world and you need to know how to handle them\n18:25\nwithout becoming one right which is a difficult thing like contagious where you can become a\n18:34\npsychopath yes it’s well it is contagious I mean one of the things we do know for example is that the worst\n18:40\nthing you can do with people who have an antisocial proclivity is to group them together so there’s a famous study done\n18:46\nin 19 1930s in a in a town called Somerville in Massachusetts um was one\n18:53\nof the first large-scale epidemiological studies designed to remediate antisocial behavior and would be Behavior that’s\n18:59\nassociated with criminality and children who have a criminal bent their diagnosis\n19:05\nis childhood conduct disorder and so you can identify precursors to criminal behavior in children early sexual U\n19:13\nexperience for example is a marker just so you know um they the Somerville crowd did an\n19:20\nintervention with with inner city kids in the 1930s designed to Sidetrack kids\n19:26\nwho were at risk for later criminal Behavior so from broken families for example in lower socioeconomic in lower\n19:34\nsocioeconomic neighborhood and they basically threw the works at them in terms of interventions and uh divided\n19:41\nthem randomly into an intervention group and a non-intervention group was actually a well-designed study and uh\n19:48\nyou know they taught them to read they taught them social skills they taught their parents parenting skills they did everything you could possibly imagine\n19:54\nthat might help remediate this developmental\n20:00\ntrajectory towards criminality one of the things they did was they took the kids out of the uh Urban environments\n20:06\nand put them in camps in summer camps for two weeks a year and the kids loved it and the counselors loved it and\n20:12\neverybody thought this the whole program was great and then they de blinded the study and analyzed the results and the\n20:18\nkids in the intervention group did far worse much more likely to be alcoholic much more likely to be criminal much\n20:24\nmore likely to suffer from severe illnesses like schizophrenia and when they did the detailed an is they found\n20:29\nthat the reason for that was that they grouped them together in summer camps and they learned to compete to be\n20:35\ncriminal right and so one of the things we know this is one of the real failures of the prison system is there isn’t\n20:40\nanything worse you can do for antisocial people than can to put them with other antisocial people because then they’re\n20:46\naround antisocial experts and they compete right well it makes sense right\n20:52\nwell that we also found too that uh so the Psychopaths not all criminals are psychopaths by the way it’s a minority\n21:00\nof criminals who are psychopaths but if you put psychopaths in group therapy it makes them worse why well they get\n21:07\nbetter at doing what they do like they’re already manipulators that’s pretty much how they operate like if if\n21:13\nI’m a psychopath and I’m talking to you the only thing I’m concerned is is with\n21:19\nwhat you can deliver like that’s it you’re just a landscape of opportunity and if you\n21:25\nhappen to be kind and sympathetic so much the better right so if you put\n21:30\nPsychopaths through group therapy they get more effective doesn’t remediate the\n21:36\npsychopathy at all it’s also very very difficult to change that very very difficult it’s very very stable from\n21:43\nlike age four onward gotcha so yes you can teach people to be more criminal and more Psychopathic and we do that quite\n21:49\neffectively in our society by the way we handle them wow so yeah it’s bad so you\n21:54\nyou’ve uh you’ve had Chris Voss who’s sitting here uh front row on your uh on\n21:59\nyour podcast before so I I yeah and I was just wondered if if you were to\n22:05\ncategorize him as a narcissist sociopath or psychopath how how do you think he would rate well fortunately I don’t have\n22:13\nto answer that question you know you know what you are\n22:18\nso good at debates and making your case and backing it up with you know not only\n22:25\nyour own view but stats I mean you have this incredible ability ability to Resource you know so much um how does\n22:32\none develop that skill uh I don’t know if everyone can because you can to a\n22:38\ngreater or lesser degree I mean um it’s helpful to have the innate ability let’s\n22:45\nsay so one of the things people differ in for example is a trait called verbal fluency It’s associated with\n22:51\nextraversion and sociability and positive Emotion by the way but verbal\n22:57\nfluency is the r at which you can think up words and there’s massive variation\n23:02\nin that so for example if I had all of you you can test it very easily so imagine I had all you people write down\n23:09\nas many words as you could that begin with the letter s in 3 minutes okay some\n23:14\nof you would produce like 30 words and some of you would produce 150 like it’s a huge variation and it’s It’s\n23:21\nassociated with verbal intelligence which is in turn associated with General cognitive ability but there are other\n23:27\nelements of intelligence that aren’t verbal so you can have lower verbal fluency and and be very good at spatial\n23:35\nintelligence for example or manipulating images but High verbal fluency is very\n23:40\nuseful with with regards to a career as a debater or public speaker and I mean I\n23:46\ndon’t know if you know who Camille pelia is but she’s off the charts and verbal fluency Ben Shapiro he’s another like\n23:52\nmachine gun speaker Russell Brand those are the people I’ve met in my life who are the most verbally fluent and that’s\n23:58\nhuge part of that’s an innate skill in terms of developing your ability to speak I would say well there’s a variety\n24:07\nof things that you can learn to do I don’t debate to win I’m not\n24:13\nparticularly interested in winning I stopped doing that when I was in my 20s when I learned that that was a\n24:18\ncounterproductive strategy what I’m trying to do when I speak is to say what\n24:24\nI believe to be true and that’s a long-term vict iory like the truth is a\n24:30\nlong-term strategy right and it’s the opposite of manipulation and so all I’m\n24:35\ntrying to do is to formulate my words as clearly as I possibly can and some of that’s an embodied sense like if you you\n24:42\ncan learn to you can learn to do this it’s really worth learning although it’s very unsettling when you start you you\n24:50\nwant to feel out whether or not the words that you’re saying are like firm\n24:58\nimagine you’re qu crossing a swampy plane and you can’t see into the water\n25:03\nyou know there’s a trail and underneath the water 6 in or so there are well set\n25:10\nFoundation stones and you can sort of feel them out as you make your way that’s how Moses went across the Red Sea\n25:16\nyou know the Sea of chaos is you can tell when you’re speaking if you pay attention what words you’re saying make\n25:23\nyou confident and that’s a way of telling that there’s firm ground under your feet and it’s the opposite of being\n25:30\nself-conscious you know if you start speaking publicly and you become self-conscious it’s because you’ve\n25:35\nbecome concerned with how people are responding to you well it’s not about\n25:41\nyou it’s not about you it’s about the validity of your words and if you’re\n25:46\nfocusing on what it is that you have to say and you find the firm words you’ll\n25:52\nbe a compelling public speaker and that’s the case too even if you’re not particularly verbally fluent because\n25:57\npeople will be to tell that what you’re doing is wrestling with the ideas at\n26:03\nhand and trying to find your way forward and everyone wants to see that that’s a\n26:09\nthat’s a kind of Highwire performance and so and that that’s way different than wanting victory like Victory\n26:17\nthere’s lots of different kinds of Victory you know there’s the egotistical victory of the moment and there’s the\n26:23\nsetting the foundations for Success across the broadest possible SP of time\n26:28\nand place into the future and the truth is a way better long-term strategy like\n26:35\nyou might pay for it in the present which is why people lie obviously but so you want to find the right words now so\n26:42\nyou you can learn to do that you got to listen to yourself talk and you got to think well do I actually believe that or\n26:48\nam I trying to impress this person or am I trying to close the business deal you know is there am I manipulating the\n26:55\nsituation so that I get what I want rather than merely trying to represent\n27:00\nthe truth now you might say well why shouldn’t you get what you want and the answer is well what the hell do you know\n27:06\nI mean how often have you been wrong about what you want lots I presume and\n27:12\nhow often have you got something what that you wanted maybe by the by a route\n27:17\nthat wasn’t the straightest let’s say and found out that that didn’t you do you any good at all it’s much better\n27:23\njust to say what you believe to be the case and that also helps you build a foundation for speaking into the future\n27:31\nit also allows you to draw on your own experience you know like there isn’t anyone who\n27:37\ncan’t comport themselves in a manner that’s interesting one of the things I learned as a clinician was that and I\n27:44\nhad a very wide variety of clients ranging from people who were just barely clinging to the edge of the Earth by\n27:50\ntheir fingernails to people who were extremely accomplished on multiple\n27:56\nDimensions you know and even the simpler people even the cognitively impaired\n28:01\npeople that I dealt with who ver who had in some cases virtually nothing going for them if I could listen hard enough\n28:09\nand get them to talk about what they knew they were immediately compelling and interesting and they had things to\n28:15\nsay and I had things to learn from them and so you can be a compelling public\n28:20\nspeaker if you actually talk about the things that you know to be true right\n28:26\nbut that means you have to forgo the the ego games that are associated it’s the same in a in a debate you\n28:34\nknow it’s a victory if you clarify your thoughts in the course of a discussion\n28:40\nthat’s a victory that’s sort of independent of the perceived victory of the moment\n28:47\nlet’s say right yeah now the other thing you can do on the public speaking side is you watch watch your speech and you\n28:55\nshould eliminate ums and likes and all those filler words that people use that\n29:03\nhas to go it it makes you inarticulate and you can learn to control that and instead of filling the pause with an um\n29:10\nor a like or a you know you can just be silent like there’s nothing wrong with\n29:16\ntaking a pause and collecting your thoughts and you want to have your goal in mind like when I go on stage when I’m\n29:23\ndoing my lectures when I’m touring I always have a question in mind mind right and that’s a priority it’s\n29:30\nlike okay what am I talking about tonight here’s the question and what does the talk consist of it talk it\n29:36\nconsists of an attempt to not only answer that question but to push the\n29:42\nanswer to the question farther than I’ve been able to push it before and that\n29:47\nadds some novelty to it and then the the talk becomes an exploration with the audience and that’s way more interesting\n29:54\nfor everyone you know you the last thing you want to do is is like read if you\n29:59\ncan avoid that don’t do that don’t do that no matter how good your re your\n30:05\npresentation is you’re going to lose most of the audience if you read it best\n30:10\nto have if you’re going to use PowerPoint use images or just a couple of phrases and you can read the phrase\n30:16\nand then discuss it you know but people want to see you actively engaging in the ideas they don’t want to hear some\n30:22\ncanned and stereotyped set of responses and you’re not there to plead the\n30:28\naudience you know they there to figure out something with everyone and what else can you do when you’re in front of\n30:34\na crowd you’re going to be afraid of the crowd but you shouldn’t be talking to the crowd there’s no crowd you can talk\n30:42\nto an individual everyone so what you do and you pick out people in the group and you talk to them you know and you look\n30:48\nat them and when you walk on stage you look everywhere so that you’re not afraid of what’s in front of you and\n30:54\nthen you just talk and you always pick people out and look at them and see if\n30:59\nthey’re paying attention and if they’re not well you got to play with the audience\n31:04\nyou know and so what is it get rid of the filler words get rid of the idea that you’re there to accomplish your\n31:11\ngoal your narrow goal try to say what’s true see if you can find your way find\n31:17\nthe words that make you feel solid it’s the opposite of self-consciousness play a bit explore\n31:24\nhave a question firmly in mind you know and risks some failure too that’s that’s\n31:29\nfun you go out on stage like I never know when I go on stage for a talk I never know if it’s going to work and\n31:36\nneither does the audience and so they’re all part of what grips them is the fact that I could just miss the mark you know\n31:44\nthat it could go nowhere and that’s a real challenge to see if you can put\n31:50\ntogether new ideas on the Fly and address the issue at hand and to bring everyone along for the ride and that’s\n31:58\nthere’s no failure if you do that even if it doesn’t work out that well like at least it’s a noble attempt that went\n32:03\nsomewhat sideways that’s something and then people get to know who you are too and so do you and that’s a good\n32:11\ndeal can be a good deal so well so to that that point to get to know who you\n32:16\nare so you have put yourself many times in positions having discussions or\n32:22\ndebates or interviews with people that you know dislike you you know they’re going to try to challenge you uh are you\n32:31\ndoing that uh I’d love to have you break down to to reach people that you feel\n32:38\nneed to be educated on a different way of thinking about it are you doing it to\n32:43\nhelp yourself get better at thinking through these difficult sort of challenges I don’t I don’t set\n32:51\nout precisely to put myself in situations like that it’s more like they\n32:57\narrive you know I’ve done a lot of interviews and some of them have been with people\n33:04\nwho are genuine interlocutors and others are\n33:10\npeople who want to play a game and so I give people the benefit of\n33:16\nthe doubt so if I meet someone I assume that we’re playing a straight game and then I watch them and if they’re playing\n33:24\na straight game then then I treat them politely and if\n33:32\nthey’re not playing a straight game I think okay what the hell are you up to and the\n33:39\nproblem is for them generally is I was a clinician for a long time and tricky\n33:45\njournalists think they’re tricky and they’re nowhere near as tricky as the people that I’ve dealt with they’re not\n33:51\neven in the same universe and so I’m serious and so if I think okay you’re\n33:57\nnot playing a straight game I see so now we’re playing clinician are we and so\n34:03\nthen I can usually figure out what the person’s up to and that’s usually not very good for them so and I don’t like\n34:10\ndoing that you know like when I meet someone socially I’m not bringing my clinical eye to bear\n34:18\nit’s the polite thing to do and the appropriate thing to do socially is to assume Goodwill and meet people there\n34:25\nand if you’re not naive that that’s a form of courage you know cuz I could be very skeptical when I meet people but\n34:32\nI’m not I think probably you’re playing a straight game at at least mostly or and good then we’ll go we’ll proceed on\n34:39\nthat basis but if that’s not the situation then I’m also prepared to play\n34:46\nthat game and so that’s worked spectacularly well upon occasion yeah\n34:53\nand it was it was often with journalists who they weren’t there to play a straight game at all and they were one\n34:59\nof them confessed in fact a woman named Nelly bus who she got me probably more\n35:04\nthan anyone else did because she was she was very very devious very very devious\n35:10\nand she fooled me into thinking she was someone other than who she was and she\n35:16\nadmitted several years later that her role at the New York Times was to seduce\n35:21\nessentially the people that she was interviewing and then continued to talk to them until\n35:28\nthey said something that she could twist into reputation destruction and Elevate\n35:34\nher status in consequence she said lots of the New York Times reporters are playing that game and that’s\n35:42\na that’s a pretty uh that’s a psychopathic game and she\n35:48\nwas particularly good at it now she did admit it and apologize\n35:54\nbut those things aren’t easy to change once you practice system and so you know maybe she learned her lesson and maybe\n36:00\nshe didn’t so so I don’t look for trouble you know\n36:06\num well I don’t I don’t look for trouble and I’ve avoided universities mostly\n36:12\nsince about 2018 because they just got way too annoying I don’t know why anybody ever goes and speaks a\n36:18\nuniversity they’re a pain in the neck they don’t pay anything they’re they\n36:23\nthink that it’s a privilege for you to speak there and sometimes it is you know that there is occasions where that’s the\n36:29\ncase but mostly it’s just it’s just not worth the trouble yeah and so I don’t I\n36:36\ndo that rarely you know and still now and then but rarely um in terms of\n36:41\ninterviews mostly what we’ve changed as a family is I I won’t do an interview without recording it and so often now if\n36:49\nI run into someone who’s playing games we just release the whole recording and that usually does the\n36:55\ntrick because I you know I I I’m not concerned about revealing what\n37:04\nit is that I’ve said and like you you may know that the Ontario College of psychologists and behavior an\n37:11\nanalysts um they changed their name how convenient for them um they’re trying to\n37:17\ntake away my license you know and right now we’re negotiating because I’m supposed to be re-educated which you\n37:24\nknow isn’t really going to work that well and\n37:29\nyou know I told them that I would do their re-education but there’s no bloody way they’re going to be able to do it in\n37:34\nsecret and they told me two weeks ago that they would proceed with the\n37:40\nre-education because they found someone who apparently is willing to do this but they told me that I couldn’t record it\n37:47\nthat they’d have a court recorder there to make a transcript but that I couldn’t have the transcript if I didn’t agree to\n37:53\nkeep it secret and now the reason that those processes procedures are usually\n37:58\nsecret is to protect the person who’s being disciplined let’s say not the people who are doing the discipline and\n38:05\nso I said well no I’m not doing that I’m going to make every bloody second of this 100% public clearly obviously\n38:15\nyou’re not doing this behind closed doors so well that was the last letter we sent back to them I don’t know what\n38:21\nthe hell they’re going to do about that but but there’s there isn’t a hope in hell that they’re going to be able to\n38:26\nstop me from recording this like not unless they’re willing to do a cavity\n38:32\nsearch so seriously like this is not happening in secret I’ve got would I say\n38:38\nI have nothing to hide you know everyone has something to hide let’s make no you\n38:44\nknow mistakes about that but there’s certainly nothing that I could possibly say in the course of a\n38:50\nre-education episode whatever the hell that would be that I wouldn’t be 100% willing to make public and that’s also\n38:56\npart and parcel of of this the consequence of this finding my words carefully you know it’s like I’m not\n39:03\nsaying things I don’t mean and then you might say well what do you mean that you mean something it’s\n39:10\nlike if I say something if I say no for example and I’ve said no I’ve said no to\n39:17\ngovernment legislation in Canada what no means is there isn’t anything you can do\n39:23\nto me that would force me to comply with your request T and I’ve thought it\n39:30\nthrough and so I did a lot of negotiating counseling with my clients\n39:35\nyou know I I know what no means I know how rarely you use it you use it when you mean it and to mean it means you\n39:42\nhave to think it through and if if you want to stop someone from having the upper hand over\n39:50\nyou you just have to give up everything they want you have to think that through it’s like okay you’re going to take my\n39:56\nlicense can I live with that well then I have to have a plan if that happens what\n40:01\nam I going to do you know if I’m all panicked about that well then I lose but\n40:06\nif I’ve Got a Way Forward it’s like okay do your worst and so well then what you know if\n40:13\nyou take away the upper hand you’re free and all you have to do to take away the\n40:19\nupper hand is to give up what’s being requested and now that you may have to think that through\n40:25\nbut they might take it anyways even if you don’t think it through so you might as well think it through and you know\n40:32\nyou may also find that unbeknownst to you there’s tremendous opportunity in\n40:37\nthat sacrifice you know like with the college for example with the psychologist it’s like not obvious to me that I want to be\n40:44\npart of their damn Club anymore because they become unbelievably corrupt like the medical establishments the medical\n40:51\nassociations you know I’m not going to let them take my license because I’m not going to let a pack of faceless bureaucrats take something me without\n40:58\nmaking their life hell but that doesn’t mean that I’m happy to be part of their\n41:03\nlittle codery so but I’ve already I can live without my license I’ve got lots of I’m\n41:11\nnot out of options not by any stretch of the imagination so yeah that’s for sure\n41:19\nuh so you did this I thought fascinating video where you analyzed Elon Musk tulsy\n41:26\nGabbert and uh JD Vance and uh Bobby Kennedy and Trump right and so in so I\n41:34\nhad a zoom with you uh the day before the elections and Trump has won uh and\n41:40\nnow we have all these people that are losing their minds that have Trump\n41:46\nderangement syndrome but there’s people that have Jordan Peterson derangement syndrome or Bobby Kennedy derangement\n41:51\nsyndrome or tucko Carlson derangement syndrome uh what do you first first off love to\n41:57\nget your thoughts on where we’re at now you and you can’t vote CU you’re a Canadian so but you have a tremendous\n42:03\namount of insight on politics and you’re you’re doing stuff well I could talk about the Democrats you know I worked\n42:10\nwith the Democrats behind the scenes for like six years a long time and and quite a lot um\n42:20\na friend of mine who I worked with who was very well connected with the DNC and\n42:27\nthe Democrat hierarchy nationally he’s one of their main political strategists\n42:33\nhe just so you all know this is something perhaps you would like to know in\n42:39\n2017 I made an offer to the\n42:45\nDemocratic party Elite me and Rogan and Dave Rubin and Brett Weinstein and Ben\n42:52\nShapiro we invited them all to come on our podcast it was an open Ed offer we\n42:57\nhave it in writing my friend his name is Greg herwitz released this the other day on Twitter because all the Democrats and\n43:04\nthe Legacy Media types are squawking up and down about the fact that the conservatives have you know created this\n43:10\nNew non-legacy Media space and are dominating it and how unfair that is it’s like you sons of we asked\n43:17\nyou for seven years 7 years to come and\n43:22\ntalk to us and he Greg got nowhere he couldn’t find one now I eventually\n43:27\ntalked to Dean Phillips who had run for president on the Democrat side if you may remember Dean because he dropped out\n43:34\nfairly early in the presidential race and he was willing to talk to me because he just got Savaged by the Democrat\n43:41\nParty structure when he dared to put his foot forward as a genuine Contender on the Democrat side so I did get to speak\n43:48\nto the odd Democrat who got bitten so hard by the radical leftists that they\n43:53\nwell that they were that they were willing to share their experience let’s say um why am I bringing that up well\n44:02\none of the things that we’re going to have to wrestle with going forward is you know the country is very disunited\n44:08\nand it isn’t useful that half the population let’s say the rough half that\n44:13\nvoted for camela Harris are living in Terror of the Trump mob first of all\n44:18\nbecause I don’t think that’s necessary and second Trump’s going to have to work with those people in many ways anyways\n44:25\nand generating a bunch of of additional enmity isn’t going to be helpful like the Democrats are going to have to wake\n44:31\nup to the danger of the radical leftists and they’re so asleep on that front that it’s a kind of bloody Miracle you know\n44:38\neven when I interviewed Mr Kennedy first that was a year ago when he just was starting his\n44:45\npresidential campaign I asked him a question that I’ve asked all the Democrats that I’ve had private\n44:50\nconversations with because these people will speak with me privately but not on the podcast I said when does the left go\n44:57\ntoo far none of them by the way I never got an answer from any of the Centrist\n45:02\nDemocrats to that question which is really quite appalling and Kennedy said I don’t want to run\n45:09\nthat kind of divisive campaign and I thought well you know fair enough but that’s not a very good answer because\n45:15\nthere’s real problems on the radical side of the Democrat political Spectrum as there are there are commensurate\n45:22\nproblems although they’re not as profound yet on the right-wing side\n45:27\nbecause there’s no shortage of derisive Anonymous gleeful\n45:33\nright-wing anti-semitic trolls online and there’s plenty of them and they’re noisy as hell and they’re not good but\n45:40\nthey don’t have the institutional power that the progressives have especially in the universities they’re just completely\n45:46\nblind to the danger of the Progressive Movement and they won’t we’ve been talking to the\n45:52\nDemocrats for seven years like the message was very clear the radical are\n45:57\ngoing to do you in and their answer was they don’t mean what they say it’s like\n46:02\nhave it your way they mean it when camela Harris was Camala Harris was talking about Equity she either didn’t\n46:10\nknow what she was talking about which is inexcusable or she knew what she was talking about which was malevolent those\n46:17\nare the options it’s like they just mean equality of opportunity it’s like then why do they have a different word they\n46:25\ndon’t mean equality of opportunity they mean equality of outcome\n46:30\nand if you’re foolish enough to believe in equality of outcome then you deserve to lose the Senate lose the house and\n46:37\nlose the presidency\n46:42\nright and that’s what happened yeah you know and I think I was talking\n46:49\nto herwitz today and he said that he believed that the swing issue was the\n46:54\ntrans issue that was enough to swing the vote and rightly so because what’s\n47:00\nhappening with regards to this surgical sterilization and mutilation of children is I have never seen any worse form of\n47:09\nmedical and psychological malpractice in not only in my life as an observer of\n47:14\nthe psychological and medical community but in my studies of serious\n47:20\nPsychopathology it is brutal and unacceptable beyond belief and it’s part\n47:26\nof the ID ology that the Democrats wouldn’t the moderate Democrats would not recognize and\n47:32\nso they’ve got a fair bit of mopping up to do and I hope they manage it because it would be good for a trump\n47:39\nAdministration especially one that’s got the reins of power the way that Trump now does to have an effective opposition\n47:46\nyou always need an effective opposition now you need an effective opposition within the confines of your own family\n47:52\nyou know so hopefully they’ll\n47:58\ndo a little soul searching and decide that postmodern communism is not the\n48:05\nright way forward so we’ll\n48:12\nsee what what what advice would you give to someone that is in their mind they\n48:18\nbelieve Trump is a rapist Trump is a racist Trump is this horrible human he\n48:23\ndoesn’t care about people and he’s also the president of the well the first thing you could probably do is stop\n48:29\nwatching CNN and MSNBC it’s like seriously you know I’ve been watching in\n48:34\nthe last week it’s been unbelievably interesting from my perspective personal perspective even to watch the Legacy\n48:40\nMedia finally wake up and realize that it’s not 2005 you know 6 months ago 7\n48:47\nmonths ago I read a an account of Gavin Nome opining about Joe Rogan and me he\n48:53\nsaid that his own son was watching Rogan and me and other Fringe figures and I\n48:59\nthought I don’t know what planet you occupy Mr Nome but Joe Rogan is the most powerful journalist who’s ever lived by\n49:06\nan order of magnitude you know CNN is The Fringe MSNBC is The Fringe Gavin\n49:12\nNewsome is The Fringe Joe Rogan is he runs the most popular podcast in 92\n49:19\ncountries it’s like that’s not Fringe and so\n49:27\nif you are suffering from Trump derangement syndrome I would say you could watch the podcast he did\n49:34\nwith Rogan and with Theo vaugh and you could see what he was actually like when he wasn’t completely on the defensive\n49:42\nfrom being attacked like no other politician in living memory has ever been attacked and the but more\n49:49\nimportantly than that even independently of trump himself and I actually think that all the torture that he’s gone\n49:55\nthrough in the last 8 years years has mellowed them out to some genuine degree even if you’re frightened of trump it’s\n50:02\nlike oh so you’re also frightened of Kennedy who was a Democrat and you’re frightened of Tulsi gabard who was a\n50:08\nDemocrat and you’re frightened of VI ramaswami and um Vance who in a normal\n50:15\nworld would be a Democrat and Trump himself who’s pretty weird Republican it’s like it’s not like well seriously\n50:23\nTrump as a republican what a crazy world we live and so Trump has gathered these\n50:29\npeople around him and he’s invited them in and accepted them and they’re a very strange crew and even if Trump has his\n50:36\nrough edges which he genuinely does it’s like well he’s not alone there now and so that’s a really good deal like my\n50:43\nsense was especially when musk jumped aboard I thought oh if musk would do\n50:49\nsomething like establish a a department of governmental efficiency I would support Trump just\n50:55\nfor that like just just that but that’s not all he’s got I think Gabbert is great she’s very very solid she’s the\n51:02\ncandidate the Democrats should have run She’s Everything CA Harris claimed to be it’s like why the hell didn’t they run\n51:07\nher they could have you know maybe it’s because she had her own thoughts I mean\n51:13\nwho knows well\n51:19\nsir so you know well and then the other thing I’d say about Trump and this is even more important than the team which\n51:25\nis really relevant but more importantly the best predictor of someone’s future behavior is their past Behavior so if\n51:32\nyou’re hiring someone you should look at their General cognitive ability you should look at their temperament but if\n51:38\nyou have a track record that’s quantifiable of their performance in\n51:44\nthat position and it’s positive it’s like there you go that’s the best evidence that you\n51:50\nhave technically and I don’t know if everyone forgot but Trump was President\n51:55\nfor four years and he wasn’t Hitler in\n52:01\nfact zero Wars zero Wars is not many\n52:06\nwars right and more than that more than that zero Wars that’s not nothing that’s\n52:13\nremarkable accomplishment you know and but more than that he also spearheaded\n52:18\nthe Abraham Accords now the possibility of establishing the Abraham Accords was\n52:23\nthere in the previous Democrat administ ation and they the state department\n52:29\ndefined it as impossible and they had for decades and even in the Trump Administration it took the Trump people\n52:35\na couple of years before they were willing to take the risk but they did take the risk and you know you may have\n52:41\nnoticed or you may not of is even after October 7th even after Iran did\n52:47\nabsolutely everything it could to drive the Muslim world into the hands of the\n52:52\nextremists they they pulled no punches in doing that it was a last ditch attempt to save their sad mullah\n53:00\nhides they Abraham Accords held and I know that if Biden would have been this\n53:07\nis an appalling fact if Biden would have been willing to give Trump some credit which he should have because Mr Trump\n53:13\nmight have just ridden off into the sunset If he if they had been willing to give the devil is due you know he should\n53:20\nhave got the Nobel Peace Prize for those abrahamic cors but even more importantly the Saudis were ready to sign that damn\n53:27\nAccord and Biden wouldn’t do it because it would shed positive light on Trump\n53:32\nand that was inexcusable it was inexcusable and my suspicions are that\n53:37\nyou know if things lay themselves out like we hope they might that the Saudis will sign the Abraham Accord in the next\n53:43\nyear or so and that’s a big deal you know it it it might even stop\n53:49\nthe you know there’s terrible animosity developing in many ways\n53:55\nbetween the extremists in the Islamic world and the West broadly speaking if\n54:00\nyou’re paying attention to X you saw what happened in Amsterdam this week which was just absolutely unforgivable\n54:07\nand almost completely underreported on the Legacy Media you know but there are\n54:13\npositive things Brewing within the Islamic world and it’s possible that the abrahamic Accords are a pathway in that\n54:19\ndirection and so and Trump he established those so no Wars and the\n54:24\nAbraham Accords and four years without being Hitler it’s like what the hell are you worried about he’s going to be\n54:30\nHitler now why now like what’s changed why would he be he’s not going to run\n54:36\nagain not least cuz he can’t but he’s also how old is he he’s 78 he’s like\n54:42\nfour more years I know he’s a tough bastard and he can keep well he is and he’s got a tremendous amount of energy\n54:49\nbut you know he’s got all these other people around him now my sense is he’ll be able to\n54:54\njust finish out these four years and end it with Grace and I\n55:02\nI given that he was President already for four years in his track record it’s like what are you worried about you\n55:08\nthink that was all a ruse and the thing about Trump is he didn’t know what he was doing that the\n55:14\nfirst time around you know he didn’t know who to hire he didn’t he did he wasn’t a politician he didn’t know anything about the ins and outs of\n55:20\nWashington really well he’s a whole different character now and you know his team is already started the difficult\n55:27\nprocess of hiring the you know tens 10,000 people that they have to staff\n55:32\nthe new Administration with they’re already all over that and so I think I think and pray that he’ll be much more\n55:40\nsuccessful the second time and hopefully he can be magnanimous you know and say to the Democrats who’ve been terrified\n55:47\ninto paralysis by the lies of the Legacy Media it’s like you know you guys can\n55:53\njust relax we’re not going on a Witch Hunt we’re just gonna get the economy rolling better than it\n55:59\never has in history and we’ve got the people behind us to do this we’ve got important things to do and so you know\n56:05\nsit back and watch and try not to fret too hard and you know the probability that the world’s coming to an end is\n56:12\nactually much lower than it was a week ago you know well you’ve already seen that you know you’ve already seen Hamas\n56:20\nmake peace noises and you’ve seen the same thing with China and Russia that’s not too bad for like three days and so\n56:27\nit wouldn’t surprise me it wouldn’t surprise me at all if Trump had a peace agreement in in hand with Russia and\n56:34\nUkraine before he takes office and I know I don’t know if you know this but there were peace offerings on the table\n56:40\nin May of 2022 and they were solid and the Russians were ready to sign and the Biden Administration refused it now you\n56:48\nknow I think there’s room for wide relevant differences of opinion about\n56:54\nthe situation in Ukraine and Russia but it is not like it’s not like the Russians won’t deal especially if\n57:01\nthey’re dealing with Trump and so I guess I’d ask the Democrats who are\n57:06\nreasonable it’s like well hold your nose for 6 months you know and try not to freak out and another thing to think\n57:13\nabout too and this is good in a general political sense I’ve thought about this very deeply you know in the biblical\n57:19\nstory of Exodus Moses is the archetypal leader and he leads his people away from\n57:26\nslavery and tyranny toward the promised land which is always what a leader does by the way through the desert of Doubt\n57:32\ntoward the promised land and Moses is severely punished at the end of his life\n57:38\nfor using Force when he’s called upon to use persuasion right so at near when the\n57:45\nIsraelites are are on the border of the promised land they run out of water it’s\n57:51\nphysical water and the Water of Life and God tells Moses to to to speak to the\n57:57\nrocks and have them deliver the water that will redeem the Israelites and instead Moses takes his staff of\n58:04\nauthority that Rod you know that can turn into a serpent that’s the magical symbol of healing by the way that the\n58:10\nPhysicians use he takes that rod and he he strikes the Rocks twice to force them\n58:16\nto comply and God’s response to that is that he sentences Moses to death before\n58:21\nhe reaches the promised land and that’s a hell of a punishment for someone who who had been a what would you say a\n58:30\ndevoted a devoted servant of God for decades and who undertook an unbelievably responsible task and who\n58:38\nUnited the fractious Israelites and took them away from slavery he’s punished why\n58:44\nbecause he used Force when he was asked to invite and convince and so one of the\n58:51\nthings to consider too when you’re trying to evaluate the claims of any given political leader any leader or\n58:57\nyourself for that matter is if you use fear and compulsion then you’re a tyrant in\n59:04\nWaiting you should formulate your offerings to people in the form of an invitation it’s like here’s something we\n59:11\ncould do together you know are you on board now it’s a little bit more difficult in the case of those people\n59:18\nwho just will not fly right you know like what do you do with criminals invitations don’t work very well and so\n59:24\nyou know you still have to have a cynical eye for people who misbehave\n59:29\nlet’s say but by and large you should be structuring your policies on an Invitational basis that’s also how you\n59:36\nFoster trust that was the big catastrophe with the covid debacle it’s like we’re going to use Force it’s like\n59:43\nokay we’re not going to trust public health for the next five decades how’s that for a response well that’s a bit\n59:50\ncounterproductive All Things Considered you know that’s a good thing to think about when you’re negotiating too it’s\n59:55\nlike you want people fully on board with your offer because then they bring their best to the table and you don’t do that\n1:00:02\nwith fear and you don’t do that with compulsion and so when you’re watching the climate Nazis for example brandish\n1:00:08\ntheir flags of Terror you think well you’re trying to frighten me into commiss into\n1:00:13\nsubmission maybe I don’t trust you then if your tools are fear and force we’re doing this for because it’s\n1:00:21\nbetter for you it’s because it’s going to bring a better future into being I see so you’re going to use fear and\n1:00:27\nforce to bring a better future into being I don’t think so I don’t think so and so that’s part\n1:00:34\nof what makes me skeptical of the climate well there’s 50 things that make me skeptical about it but one of them\n1:00:41\nthe most fundamental is likely I see you’re going to compel people to do this are you instead of making energy cheaper\n1:00:49\nwhich is what you would do if you were competent no we’re going to make it five times as expensive and we’re going to force you to use it it’s like okay got\n1:00:56\nit I understand they’ve done that in the UK right UK Energy prices are about five\n1:01:01\ntimes what they are in the US and that means all the poor people are way poorer\n1:01:06\nthan they would have to be and I don’t see that as a net gain so yeah I want to\n1:01:13\ndo a shout out we have a mutual friend Alex Epstein who wrote the book fossil Futures and his first book was a moral\n1:01:19\ncase for fossil fuels he has a great website energy\n1:01:26\nthe research and the data and the language so that they can speak effectively about energy and he’s just I\n1:01:31\nthink he’s absolutely brilliant has put so yeah yeah yeah yeah he’s a single-minded terror\n1:01:36\nEpstein yeah yeah he’s very useful to totally well let let you know what when we were talking um uh you know I have a\n1:01:45\nbook life gives to the giver which is this is a really clever way of me plugging my book while I’m interviewing you um but we were talking about giving\n1:01:52\nand you had made this comment which I loved because me and Dan Sullivan did a whole podcast on this where you said the\n1:01:58\nthe term and I didn’t initiate this you said it you’re like this whole uh this\n1:02:03\nterm uh give back it’s just it’s just not I think you maybe use toxic I’m not sure how you described it but I’m\n1:02:10\nfinally going to give back I’ve been robbing you people blind while I made my fortune and finally I’m going to give\n1:02:16\nback it’s like that’s a great message for capitalists and entrepreneurs it’s like you’re completely right that I was\n1:02:21\na thief but now I’m guilty and so it’s like one of the the things I’ve been talking to entrepreneurs about\n1:02:28\nespecially on the energy side it’s like you you got to give up your guilt it’s it’s pathological like maybe you have\n1:02:35\nsome things to be guilty about you should sort that out but with regards to your well seriously but with regards to\n1:02:41\nyour fundamental Enterprise it’s like you you you built a thriving business well what are you getting are guilty\n1:02:47\nabout that you think you if you stole from people while you’re doing it well then you need a slap and you should straighten yourself out but if you\n1:02:53\nactually built an Enterprise that works and that you’re off offering people a valid service and they’re accepting it\n1:02:59\nvoluntarily and you’re efficient enough to do that profitably and you employ a bunch of people and you’re growing it’s\n1:03:04\nlike that’s good you that might be good enough you don’t have to give back you\n1:03:10\nknow all that means is you’ve accepted all that leftist propaganda that property is theft or some bloody thing\n1:03:16\nproperty is theft except their property you know and so no no it’s it’s time for\n1:03:23\nespecially conservative entrepreneurs or just bu of ver in general to drop that idiot guilt I mean one of the I’ve been\n1:03:29\nin a lot of countries like a lot and and mostly in the west but one of the things\n1:03:34\nI can tell you for certain there is something about this country that’s different from every other country and\n1:03:42\nwhat’s different about this country is that the there is a default admiration\n1:03:48\nin the United States for Success the default assumption in the United States is you can succeed and you can deserve\n1:03:55\nit and then there’s another assumption that’s sort of right underneath that which is my children could be one of\n1:04:01\nthose people who succeeds and deserves it now everywhere else in the world including my home country there’s this\n1:04:07\nambivalence about success it’s like it’s uh well you know are you sure you’re not\n1:04:13\npart of the power mad patriarchy and just taking from people and you know that’s a question for your own\n1:04:18\nconscience if you’re a crooked dealer and some of what you’ve acred is a consequence of you know sharp trading\n1:04:23\nand lies well you know that’s on your own conscience and you bloody well will pay for it but if you’ve played a\n1:04:30\nstraight game and generally the only way to make a business that succeeds across any reasonable span of time is to play a\n1:04:35\nstraight game then you should stop being guilty about it you should be the\n1:04:41\nopposite of that I think it’s that this is what an Rand got right it’s like there’s an element to\n1:04:47\nentrepreneurial Kingdom building that’s as laudable as anything you could manage it’s not an easy thing to run an\n1:04:53\nefficient organization that offers people at genuine service at a competitive cost that they can use\n1:05:00\nvoluntarily and that they’re happy with that’s a moral\n1:05:07\naccomplishment yeah in your country it is definitely the case you know I mean I’ve gone through almost all of Europe\n1:05:14\nand and and met many people in all of those countries and I know Canada and the UK extremely well and Australia New\n1:05:21\nZealand no you guys there’s something unique about the United States and that that’s that American Dream element that\n1:05:29\nthat admiration for entrepreneurial Excellence that while you see that manifested in someone like Elon Musk and\n1:05:36\nyou know two thumbs up for that as far as I’m concerned and it would be lovely especially over the next four years if\n1:05:43\nall you entrepreneurial types stop letting the radical progressives have the moral upper hand because they’re for\n1:05:48\nthe poor it’s like no they’re not not a not even a bit all the bloody green\n1:05:54\nleftists have done in Europe is doomed the poor to extensive and deteriorating poverty that’s all they’ve done they\n1:06:00\nhaven’t cleaned up the environment one bit electricity is five times as expensive in Germany as it is in France\n1:06:07\nand they burn more coal than they did before they shot off their nuclear power plants so not only is energy expensive\n1:06:15\nand unreliable and provided by dictators it’s much filthier than it was they\n1:06:21\nfailed on every single front all the while raising ra you know flying the flag we’re for the poor it’s like I\n1:06:27\ndon’t think so if you’re making energy more expensive you hate the poor it’s\n1:06:32\nstraightforward you make people Rich by making energy cheap and so hopefully the Trump Administration will act on that as\n1:06:40\nhe did before and drive energy costs down so America can like bullet forward like this\n1:06:47\ncountry is capable of and establish an example for the world like you have so many times so that would be a lovely\n1:06:54\nthing to see and you know if you’re figuring out how to provide better services for lower cost which is what\n1:07:00\nall of you are doing at least to some degree in so far as your Enterprises are successful you are in service of the\n1:07:07\npoor and we know perfectly well we know with 100% certainty that free markets\n1:07:15\nand voluntary trade is the pathway out of poverty for the world there is no doubt about that and anybody who claims\n1:07:21\ndifferent is ideologically addled narcissistic and what would you say and\n1:07:27\nmorally posturing and so it’s time for you entrepreneurial types to drop your\n1:07:32\nguilt with regards to your success that I mean assuming that like I said you know you may have bits of your\n1:07:38\nconscience to come to terms with but so does everybody else and you can fail dismally and be an immoral rat too you\n1:07:46\nknow so the mere fact that you haven’t accomplished anything doesn’t indicate that you’re\n1:07:51\nvirtuous so [Applause]\n1:07:59\nso it’s really hard to get you excited about certain subjects I mean that’s that’s uh let me do some rapid fire\n1:08:06\nquestions then I’d love to take just a few minutes for some uh just a maybe a\n1:08:11\ncouple questions from the audience so two to four tops just because of timing\n1:08:16\nuh so favorite book Crime and Punishment uh solution to suffering\n1:08:27\nresponsibility most difficult time in your life oh there is a period of about 3\n1:08:34\nyears not very long ago where my wife and my daughter and I were both extremely ill and so that lasted about 3\n1:08:40\nyears and so that was three is a lot one is a lot three is a lot so and that was\n1:08:48\nreally brutal okay uh favorite place to travel Florence Italy is hard to beat\n1:08:57\num I went to this place called meteor in Greece too and man that was something else that’s a strange place that used to\n1:09:04\nbe an underwater ocean and it’s all it is is this landscape of mesas they’re\n1:09:09\nreally tall like 1500 ft and in this Stark mountainous landscape and it\n1:09:15\nthere’s 24 monasteries there built on these absolutely inaccessible Cliffs it’s it’s well they filmed a James Bond\n1:09:24\nmovie there for a reason it’s like it’s like shangra La Meteora deadly\n1:09:29\nremarkable place I’m I’m glad I’m getting my travel plans here too this is helpful um entrepreneur you\n1:09:37\nadmire well Elon Musk is definitely one of them I have a brother-in-law Jim Keller and uh he’s a he’s an absolute\n1:09:45\ngenius Jim he he’s worked for Elon he worked for Steve Jobs Jim designed all the computer chips and everything that\n1:09:51\nyou use all the apple chips virtually all the AMD chips all Intel chips Jim is\n1:09:56\nthe chip designer who moves from company to company competing with the last chip that he built and he’s built he’s\n1:10:03\nbuilding a printer at the moment that he thinks he’ll be able to print anything and so like a 3D printer yeah wow yeah\n1:10:13\nyeah Atomic level deposition so we’re going to see things come up in the next 10 years that we just can’t possibly\n1:10:20\nimagine and musk is definitely on the Forefront of that you know that those cars he’s build those self-driving cars\n1:10:27\nthose aren’t cars those are robots they just happen to have four wheels and musk is going to\n1:10:34\ntake all the data that those robots have already collected which is a lot and he’s going to put all that data into his\n1:10:40\nOptimus robots and that’s coming down the pipelines unbelievably quickly so\n1:10:45\nassuming that we don’t allow everything to go to hell in a hand basket which we certainly\n1:10:51\ncould we’re going to see things in the next 10 years that no one’s going to be able to believe\n1:10:56\nso and musk is definitely going to be at the Forefront of that he’s quite\n1:11:01\nthe improbable creature and now you’ve got him in your government assuming that\n1:11:07\neverybody allows him to live I guess we’ll find out about that but I got to find that Meme that I uh you know if\n1:11:15\nsome uh someone on my team could text me the meme I showed yesterday morning about Elon Musk now he you know it it it\n1:11:21\nwas um uh said along the lines of uh how stupid him to spend 44 million on\n1:11:27\nTwitter now he just controls three branches of government yeah no kidding yeah yeah you don’t second guessing Elon\n1:11:34\nMusk is a Fool’s game he doesn’t know what he’s doing it’s like how many Rockets have you sent to Mars well\n1:11:42\nseriously you know people are so presumptuous you know if he’d only done one impossible thing you’d think you\n1:11:47\ncould you know you could excuse that because you’re so embarrassed to not be him and you could excuse that and say\n1:11:53\nwell it’s government subsidies or it was handed to him which is all complete bloody rubbish cuz you can hand\n1:11:58\ngovernment subsidies to a fool forever and all that’ll happen is you’ll get 1,600 ft of High-Speed Rail built in\n1:12:05\nCalifornia in 20 years for $1 billion you know and so that happened right that\n1:12:11\nhappened and so but musk has done like five impossible things and so five is a\n1:12:17\nlot like one is a lot but five that’s just that’s really a lot and so second\n1:12:22\nguessing him it’s like why did he spend 40 billion dollar on Twitter it’s like cuz he knows things you don’t like many\n1:12:30\nthings books full of things so that’s great yeah he’s he’s an incredible entrepreneur yeah and I think he’s a\n1:12:36\ngood person or I said in my analysis or he’s an absolutely terrible person trying really hard to be good which is\n1:12:43\nthat’s even better and closer to the truth and I think it is the truth in his case cuz he’s a complicated guy he’s got\n1:12:49\nsome dark corners but you know he’s doing his best to aim up as you can tell by the fact that he’s shooting Rock to\n1:12:55\nMars and so and he’s very pro-human in his orientation and you know that’s\n1:13:00\nanother rule of thumb if you are talking to someone who says you know there there are too many people on the planet it’s\n1:13:06\nlike oh yeah what devil has your tongue there buddy which people do you mean\n1:13:12\nexactly and what’s your plan for the excess oh I didn’t mean that it’s like\n1:13:17\nno but the devil that had your tongue meant it you’re just a puppet you got to be careful when you’re a puppet of\n1:13:24\ngenocidal cliches and seriously I’m dead serious about that and so musk you know\n1:13:30\nmusk is very pro-human in his orientation and so since we’re all human\n1:13:36\nthat’s probably a good thing and it’s a good thing that someone like that is maybe on The Cutting Edge of the AI\n1:13:42\nRevolution because you know chat GPT and these other models that have been trained on woke stupidity they’ve got a\n1:13:49\nfew knots to untangle you know I think chat GPT was asked recently for example\n1:13:55\nif it was uh whether a nuclear Holocaust would be preferable to misgendering\n1:14:00\nCaitlyn Jennings and it said no and so that’s not good like seriously because\n1:14:07\nno matter what you think about Caitlyn Jenners Jenners Jennings Caitlyn Jenner Jenner Caitlyn Jenner i’ I’d pick\n1:14:16\nmisgendering her rather than the nuclear war but chat GPT wouldn’t and that’s not\n1:14:22\ngood those bloody systems they’re smart and they’re getting smarter fast like so\n1:14:27\nfast you can’t believe it and they’re not ethically oriented in the proper\n1:14:33\ndirection because they’ve been trained badly by Engineers who understand nothing about ethics and so I’m very\n1:14:39\nhappy that musk is in that game and at the moment on The Cutting Edge so you\n1:14:46\nknow thank God for small mercies or large Mercies in his case yeah totally\n1:14:52\ntotally uh favorite author well I doeski is my favorite author I\n1:14:58\nwould say uh philosopher n uh quick path out of sadness or anger\n1:15:06\ngratitude gratitude yeah that’s a hell are you so quick I mean this is like amazing that’s\n1:15:13\na practice does it does it occur to you how intelligent you\n1:15:18\nare I mean do you think about that in terms of how other people’s capabilities to access I’m not saying this\n1:15:26\ntoo um yeah I’m not being flipping about it I mean you you operate at a freaking\n1:15:32\nhigh level of you know there’s the figure of Lucifer the mythological figure of Lucifer is the intellect\n1:15:39\nunbridled right so Lucifer is the morning star who brings Enlightenment\n1:15:44\nand Lucifer the Mythos is that Lucifer was the highest angel in God’s Heavenly\n1:15:50\nKingdom gone most spectacularly wrong and that’s the intellect\n1:15:55\nif you start to worship the intellect you are in serious you are in serious trouble way more serious trouble than\n1:16:02\nyou think and so if you’re smart and you’ve been given a gift whatever the\n1:16:08\ngift is you understand that you’ve been given that gift and that you have a responsibility to use it properly and\n1:16:14\nthat’s true for any gift that you’ve been given and so you know that’s what I think about intelligence in general it’s\n1:16:20\na it’s a good servant but a very bad Master like a very bad master and so you\n1:16:26\nknow I try to make sure that whatever talents I have are oriented towards something that’s not me let’s say\n1:16:35\nso that’s yeah that I don’t have much of an answer beyond that uh scariest time in your life yeah\n1:16:43\nwell that was this period of yeah you know a lot of things have happened to me in the last eight years God that’s for\n1:16:49\nsure you know when everything blew up around me in 2016 my professorship became impossible\n1:16:55\nI lo I lost my clinical practice and the Canadian equivalent of the IRS was after me all in the same month so that kind of\n1:17:03\nsucked and the the the CRA that’s the IRS equivalent they admitted 6 months\n1:17:09\nlater that it was their mistake thank you very much gentlemen that was just what I needed and you know I two of my\n1:17:16\nsources of income were taken out as well as my clinical practice was devastated and like I said it became impossible for\n1:17:23\nme to continue as a professor that was a lot that was a lot to contend with at\n1:17:28\nonce now you know I didn’t open my mouth in the public sphere until I was very\n1:17:35\nmuch prepared and I had three sources of income not two and so losing two was annoying and dangerous but not\n1:17:43\ncatastrophic and I was also prepared because when I I produced some videos\n1:17:48\ncomplaining about the government in Canada but I’d already put up this was in by 2016 I already put put up about\n1:17:55\n200 hours of videos that were pretty much everything I’d ever said to a student in my entire professional career\n1:18:01\nand so you know when all this when the reputation Savages came for me I was\n1:18:09\npretty prepared but that all of this the last8 years have been very unsettling you know I mean everything’s been thrown\n1:18:15\nup in the air and then including you know I just about lost my wife and my daughter was very ill and so was I and\n1:18:22\nso and that all happened at once so so the whole 8-year period has\n1:18:27\nbeen incredibly intense but is that scary yeah I mean I get I I\n1:18:35\nthink even the success has to be I mean you’ve got literally millions of people online that watch and follow you\n1:18:42\nprobably daily and I don’t know how many countless tens of thousands maybe it’s in the millions of people that swear you\n1:18:49\njust have changed their life saved their life I mean yeah well that’s a pretty good deal really good deal you know and\n1:18:55\nwell and you know the the counterbalance to the online horror let’s say is that\n1:19:00\nmy life isn’t like my life isn’t what you’d expect if you only knew about me\n1:19:06\nonline so to speak you know I mean it seems if you watch the online spectacle that I’m\n1:19:13\ncontinually EMB battled and that’s not true it’s just not true my life is an\n1:19:18\nendless stream of events like this they’re very positive events you know the crowds are very welcoming\n1:19:25\nthe spirit is upward oriented um and when I’m out in public you know I have\n1:19:32\nsecurity and people keep an eye on me and we try not to do anything too stupid but all of the encounters I have with\n1:19:39\npeople in the actual world are ridiculously positive with you know tiny\n1:19:44\ntiny exceptions like one in 10,000 and it’s usually people who well they have\n1:19:50\nyou know they’re very respectful and they’re very polite and they have something meaning to say and they have\n1:19:55\nan anecdote to share that is worth listening to and that’s great and wherever I go you know which is a\n1:20:02\nremarkable thing is that wherever I go it’s very\n1:20:08\nweird it’s very weird to be able to go anywhere in the world and be among\n1:20:13\nfriends it’s very strange because of course people feel that they know me and I suppose they do because I’m not any\n1:20:19\ndifferent what you see online that’s what that’s who I am there’s\n1:20:25\nno facade certainly not one that’s maintainable for like 15 if you maintain\n1:20:32\na facade for 15 years you just become the facade right there’s no keeping\n1:20:37\nyourself separate from that so it’s a remarkable thing to be able to travel anywhere in the world and to be\n1:20:45\nwelcomed yeah that’s a good deal that’s a good\n1:20:50\ndeal that’s worth some suffering definitely you know and you can have\n1:20:55\nthat in the confines of your own organization if you play a straight game it’s like why wouldn’t people be happy\n1:21:01\nwith you you know you’re aiming up you’re bringing them along everything’s getting better for you and for\n1:21:07\nthem and then you can see how where can you take that you know\n1:21:13\nevery one of you has your own kingdom that’s one of the things that’s wonderful about the United States is\n1:21:19\nyou’ve got your own kingdom well what’s what’s going to rule there whatever you\n1:21:26\nwant you know that’s a good deal and so I have a great deal it’s a great deal\n1:21:33\nyeah that’s one of my goals with even genius network is just to help everyone have their own version of that in their\n1:21:39\nown life because um yeah we live in an infinite expans of upward opportunity\n1:21:46\nthat’s the nature of the world that’s the fundamental nature of the world and the people who say you\n1:21:51\nknow it’s a malthusian nightmare there’s only so much we have to Scrabble we have to squabble over the what would you say\n1:21:59\nthe the fragments that fall off the king’s table that’s complete nonsense\n1:22:05\nthere’s no limit to up just like there’s no limit to down and so and musk knows that for\n1:22:12\nexample and that’s the right way to think of the world the world is a realm of infinite possibility that’s the toou\n1:22:19\nvabo by the way that God’s spirit rested upon at the beginning of time it’s a pool of infinite possibility out of\n1:22:26\nwhich order is continually extracted and if you’re aiming upward and what would you say comporting yourself as a proper\n1:22:32\nimage of the Divine then you can bring the order that’s good into being and\n1:22:38\neveryone has that nature and opportunity you know and you’ve realized that in your own Enterprises and there’s no\n1:22:44\nlimit to the scope of that so that’s a lovely thing to know I don’t think there is a more\n1:22:51\nprofound truth than that fundamentally what’s the world made of the possibility that confronts your\n1:22:58\nexploratory Consciousness and it’s constrained you know because there’s a reality to it but\n1:23:04\nit’s also indefinite in terms of possibility\n1:23:10\nso so make the most of it see what you can do in your you know in the short\n1:23:15\nduration you have in front of you you know that Adventure uh we are past time but I want\n1:23:23\nto uh so you have a new book coming out we who wrestle with God yeah which I have wrestled with God my whole life and\n1:23:30\nuh you know a little bit of my background with my mother and I was raised Catholic most of you know that uh\n1:23:37\nGod is uh so I’d love for you to talk about your new book I’d also would like\n1:23:42\nall of you to um go and pre-order it on Amazon uh or audible if you prefer\n1:23:49\naudio uh I’ve not you just sent it to me like a few days ago so I will read it I\n1:23:54\nhaven’t read it yet but I’ve read the beginning part uh and uh I’d love for you to share what\n1:24:00\nthe book is about and if you don’t buy the book I will buy it for you because I’d like everyone to have and I’d love to at some point maybe bring you to 100K\n1:24:07\nmeeting have you do a conversation about it um but what is uh to share a little about the book well I I I’ll I’ll I’ll\n1:24:15\ngive you the brief version\n1:24:21\nso one of the claims of the postmodernists was\n1:24:27\nthat we see the world through a story and that’s technically true part\n1:24:33\nof the reason we’re in a culture War that’s deep part of the reason that the universities are in runes is because the\n1:24:40\npostmodern claim that we see the world through a story is true you can’t aggregate you can’t\n1:24:48\nnavigate your way through the world in mere consequence of the facts not least\n1:24:55\nbecause there’s an infinite number of facts there’s one fact for every phenomenon and so you can’t Orient\n1:25:02\nYourself by the facts you have to prioritize the facts and a description\n1:25:08\nof the way that we prioritize the facts is a story so when you go to a movie and you watch James Bond maneuver on his\n1:25:16\ngreat romantic adventure you see how he prioritizes his attention and his actions you see what his priorities are\n1:25:23\nand you embody his story you see the world through a story now the\n1:25:28\npostmodernists especially the French postmodernists who mostly were Marxist jump to the conclusion that the story\n1:25:35\nthat we see the world through is one of power that that’s the fundamental story\n1:25:41\nand that’s not true it’s not true scientifically it’s not true technically\n1:25:48\nand it’s not implementable because stories based on power are inefficient and they breed internal dissent and\n1:25:56\nRebellion they fail and I think that is an unassailable\n1:26:01\nfact by the way fact about stories let’s say so then the question is if we see\n1:26:06\nthe world through this through a story What story do we or should we see the world through and the biblical claim is\n1:26:14\nthat the proper story is one of sacrifice and that’s a hard thing for people to understand because the\n1:26:20\nbiblical stories present sacrifice in a rather anachronistic manner it’s not\n1:26:25\nobvious what the old testament’s prophets were up to when they built altars and offered some you know a burnt\n1:26:32\noffering to God but you see they they were acting out something that is\n1:26:39\nperfectly comprehensible once it’s explained to do something means to\n1:26:46\nsacrifice everything else everything you do is a sacrifice\n1:26:51\nevery glance you make is a sacrifice because you could be looking elsewhere every word you utter is a sacrifice\n1:26:57\nbecause you could have said something else every time you pay attention to someone rather than someone else you\n1:27:04\nsacrifice what you didn’t pay attention to to what you did pay attention to\n1:27:09\nthere’s no difference between sacrifice and work because when you work you sacrifice the the Delights of the\n1:27:16\npresent to the stability of the future and the community the community is\n1:27:21\nfounded on sacrifice and so is the psyche that’s the literal\n1:27:27\ntruth and so the human story is one of sacrifice and once you understand that\n1:27:33\nthe next question is what’s the highest form of sacrifice because if you’re going to\n1:27:39\nsacrifice you might as well do it properly rather than improperly and the biblical library because it is a library\n1:27:45\nis an investigation into the structure of upward oriented sacrifice so you can\n1:27:51\nimagine this in your own life as you people entrepreneurs have climbed the\n1:27:56\nladder of your own life you can imagine that there were decision points that you\n1:28:02\ncame a you came across where you had to leave some things behind so that you\n1:28:07\ncould become who you were aiming at becoming and that upward spiraling\n1:28:13\nspiraling process of transformation that’s the sacrificial adventure of Life\n1:28:19\nAbraham himself you know he starts out privileged wealthy y protected he\n1:28:25\ndoesn’t have to lift a finger he has wealthy parents and the voice of God comes to him as the voice of sacrificial\n1:28:31\nAdventure it’s like leave your zone of comfort and go out and have the terrible\n1:28:37\nadventure of your life and Abraham does that and at each after each episode\n1:28:43\nafter each episode of transformation he rekindles his affirmation to aim at the\n1:28:49\nhighest possible Target and as a consequence his personality improves every upward and then quality of the\n1:28:56\nsacrifices that he’s called upon to offer become higher and higher it culminates in the case of Abraham with\n1:29:03\nhim having to offer his son and what that means in your own life is that as you develop upward as you\n1:29:09\nwalk up Jacob’s Ladder let’s say the depth of the sacrifices that you will be\n1:29:15\ncalled upon to undertake to continue your spiraling process upward will increase in magnitude and meaning\n1:29:22\nsignificance and that’s the pathway of life it’s the never ending sacrificial\n1:29:28\nVoyage up the ladder to heaven and so I explain that in this book and I talk\n1:29:34\nabout the story of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel and Jacob and um the Tower of\n1:29:40\nBabel which is what we inhabit now and the story of Abraham and the story of\n1:29:46\nMoses and the story of Elijah and Elijah is the first prophet who you are going to ask some questions about passion you\n1:29:53\nknow is passion passion sufficient to run an Enterprise the answer to that is no you have to consult your conscience\n1:29:59\ntoo you know passion pulls you forward but you have to stay on the straight and narrow path and conscience is the Divine\n1:30:06\nvoice that tells you when you’re violating the intrinsic moral order and\n1:30:12\ngo Elijah pre presents God as the voice of conscience within the still Small\n1:30:17\nVoice that’s very much worth knowing and so what I’ve done with we who wrestle\n1:30:22\nwith God is to take these stories and they are the stories upon which American civilization is founded there’s no\n1:30:29\nhistorical doubt about that and I tried to explain what the stories mean and why\n1:30:35\nthey’re true why they’re a deep form of Truth and why you need to know them because\n1:30:42\nyou live in a story and once you know that it’s like okay what’s the story going to be and\n1:30:50\nthe story of Abraham for example that’s the story it’s not the story of Comfort it’s not the story of security it’s not\n1:30:56\nthe story of wealth it’s the story of romantic adventure and that’s human\n1:31:02\nbeings like we’re not designed for Comfort we’re not designed for\n1:31:07\nsafety we all die we’re our lives are bounded by mortality we’re here for the\n1:31:15\nadventure and so that’s the right way to construe yourself it’s like what can you\n1:31:20\npossibly manage what What can you extract out of the realm of possibility\n1:31:26\nthat confronts you that justifies the constraints of your existence right what\n1:31:33\nremarkable things can you do that justify the fact of your\n1:31:38\nsuffering all that’s a question for everyone and it’s a wonderful thing to wrestle with think that was difficult\n1:31:46\nbut it was worth it right that’s a good deal for you that’s a good deal to offer\n1:31:51\npeople here’s something difficult but worth it yeah that’s a lot different\n1:31:57\nthan infantile satiation let’s say right or self-serving Hedonism or nihilistic\n1:32:06\ncollapse or the notion that we have nothing to talk about it’s only a power dispute between the two of us dismal\n1:32:14\nbloody stories and self-defeating so that story of upward sacrificial\n1:32:20\nAdventure that’s the that’s the Story the second book in this series will be a\n1:32:27\ninvestigation into the story of job and into the passion story I have a seminar\n1:32:33\ncoming out on the daily wire on the gospels which was partly a precursor to the second book in this series so\n1:32:42\nthe what would you say the central message of the Gospel accounts is that\n1:32:48\nyou’re called upon to offer up everything in the service of what’s highest everything right\n1:32:54\nFamily Friends Community wealth life but you\n1:33:00\nthink well how could you possibly do anything better than to offer everything you have\n1:33:05\nto what’s highest what could possibly be better than that you serve your own\n1:33:12\nwhims that doesn’t even work for twoy olds so that’s what the book is about\n1:33:19\nsacrificial adventure and what that means and why that’s the necess necessarily by necessity the foundation\n1:33:26\nof free and productive the free and productive communities that\n1:33:33\npeople what would you say unite voluntarily to produce and\n1:33:39\nmaintain and I think it’s I think the story is Rock Solid and I think we’re at a point this is part of this\n1:33:46\nremarkable the remarkable nature of the present I think the scientific accounts\n1:33:52\nand the theological accounts have converged and I tried to make that a\n1:33:57\ncriteria for the arguments that I made in the book it’s like if it didn’t work scientifically and theologically I just\n1:34:03\ndidn’t use the argument so it’s quite fun it’s terrifying\n1:34:13\nbut where there’s a lot of Terror there’s a lots of possibility right that’s a great quote\n1:34:20\nwherever there’s a lot of Terror there’s a lot of possibility yeah well that’s dragons and treasure\n1:34:26\npeople Jordan Peterson\n1:34:38\neveryone this is a organized systematic devious nefarious project by these\n1:34:45\nElites they want to Rob us of our sovereignty and they’re creating a generation of of Americans that you know\n1:34:52\nthat will do what they’re told and that won’t stand up to Authority this is all about you know unraveling\n1:34:59\nthe corruption and restoring the freedoms of our country and restoring self sovereignty and

Why is it that very sophisticated societies have been as susceptible as stone age tribes to mass delusion and the rise of destructive ideologies?”\n\nTranscript \n00:00:00 Speaker 1 \nWho is supposed to be the arbiter of truth between the human and the computer together, do you think? \n00:00:07 Speaker 1 \nThat AI will actually help us. \n00:00:10 Speaker 1 \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans only have relationships? \n00:00:20 Speaker 1 \nWith AI. \n00:00:22 Speaker 1 \nWhat is your worst case fear about? \n00:00:24 Speaker 1 \nAll of this. \n00:00:26 Speaker 2 \nI’m Ivan mahari. I’m a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the author of Nexus, A History of information networks from the Stone Age to AI. \n00:00:38 Speaker 2 \nIf you consider, for instance, that we have managed to reach the Moon to split the atom to the cipher DNA, and yet with all our knowledge and wisdom, we are on the verge of destroying ourselves and a traditional answer to this question. \n00:00:58 Speaker 2 \nIs that there is something wrong in human nature, but the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. \n00:01:09 Speaker 2 \nIf you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. So why is it that the quality of our information did not improve over thousands of years of history? Why is it that very sophisticated societies in the 20th and 21st century? \n00:01:29 Speaker 2 \nHave been as susceptible as Stone Age tribes to mass delusion and psychosis, and the rise of destructive ideologies like Stalinism or Nazism. \n00:01:56 Speaker 1 \nGood. \n00:01:56 Speaker 1 \nEverybody, thank you for being here. It is a privilege for me to be here with you, Val. I’ve been a long time fan of his back. When Sapiens was first published, and there is so much to talk about. \n00:02:10 Speaker 1 \nBetween then and now, and how we think about AI and how we think about this new reality, something that I think was actually a theme in your earliest books about reality and truth and information. \n00:02:23 Speaker 1 \nAnd in a world where it’s going to become all electronic and in a cloud, in the sky, in a whole new way, what it ultimately means when you think about history. So thank you for being. \n00:02:34 Speaker 1 \nHere we’re going to. \n00:02:36 Speaker 1 \nTalk about so many things, but I’m going to tell you where we want to start tonight. If I could. I want to read you something. This is you, you said. \n00:02:44 Speaker 1 \nThat humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation. But the way these networks are built. \n00:02:53 Speaker 1 \nElse predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our problem then is a network problem. You call it, but even more specifically, you say it’s an information problem. \n00:03:08 Speaker 1 \nI want you. \n00:03:09 Speaker 1 \nTo try to unpack that for the audience this evening, because I think that that more than anything else in this book explains, or at least sets the table for what this discussion is all about. \n00:03:23 Speaker 2 \nSo basically the the key question of the book, and of much of human history is if we are so smart, why are we so stupid? \n00:03:34 Speaker 2 \nThat’s the key question. \n00:03:36 Speaker 2 \nI mean, we can, you know, we can reach the moon, we can split the atom, we can create an eye. And yet we are on the verge of destroying ourselves. And not just through one way, like previously. We just said nuclear our war to destroy ourselves. Now we’ve created an entire menu of ways to destroy ourselves. \n00:03:58 \nSo. \n00:03:59 Speaker 2 \nWhat is happening and you know one basic answer in many mythologies is that there is something wrong with human nature. \n00:04:10 Speaker 2 \nThat we reach for powers that we don’t know how to use wisely, that there was really something deeply wrong with us. \n00:04:17 Speaker 2 \nAnd the answer that I try to give in the book is that the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. \n00:04:26 Speaker 2 \nThat if you go, if you give good people bad information, they will make bad decisions, self-destructive decisions and this has been happening again and again in history. \n00:04:39 Speaker 2 \nBecause information isn’t truth, and information isn’t wisdom. The most basic function of information is connection. \n00:04:49 Speaker 2 \nInformation connects many people to a network, and unfortunately the easiest way to connect large numbers of people together is not with the truth, but with fictions and fantasies and delusions. \n00:05:05 \nWhat it? \n00:05:05 Speaker 1 \nWas going to say there’s there’s a sense, though, that information was supposed to set us free. \n00:05:09 Speaker 1 \nInformation access to information across the world was the was the thing that was supposed to make us a a better, a better planet. \n00:05:19 Speaker 2 \nWhy would we do that? \n00:05:23 Speaker 1 \nWell, there was a sense that people in in, in places that didn’t have access to communication tools and other things didn’t have access to information and didn’t have access and maybe to put a point on it to. \n00:05:34 Speaker 1 \nGood information. \n00:05:36 Speaker 1 \nYou make the argument and now to go back to Sapiens. Frankly, you talk about different types of realities and this is what I think is very interesting because you talk about objective reality. You know, we can go outside and we can see that it’s not raining and the sky is blue. And you’d say that’s an objective reality, right? \n00:05:55 Speaker 1 \nBut then there are these other kinds of realities that you talk about, which makes us, I think, susceptible to what you’re describing. When I say susceptible this idea that we as a group, as humanity that we are storytellers and that we are OK, oddly enough with what you’ve described as a fictional. \n00:06:15 Speaker 1 \nReality. \n00:06:17 Speaker 2 \nYeah, I mean. \n00:06:19 Speaker 2 \nTo take an example, suppose we want to build an atom bomb. \n00:06:25 Speaker 2 \nTo do that, suppose that’s false. Somebody wants to build an atom bomb. \n00:06:25 Speaker 1 \nSuppose just. \n00:06:31 Speaker 2 \nYou need to know some facts to build an atom bomb. You need some hold on objective physical reality. If you don’t know that E equals MC square. If you don’t know the fact of physics, you will not be able to build an atom bomb, but to build an atom bomb you need something else. Besides knowing the fact of physics. \n00:06:53 Speaker 2 \nYou need millions and millions of people. \n00:06:56 Speaker 2 \nFor it. \n00:06:58 Speaker 2 \nNot just the physicists, but also the miners who mine uranium and the engineers and builders who build the reactor, and the farmers that grow rice and wheat in order to seed all the physicists and engineers and miners and so forth. And how do you get millions of people to cooperate? \n00:07:18 Speaker 2 \nA project like building an atom bomb, if you just tell them the fact of physics look in equals MC square. Now go to it. Nobody would do it. It’s not inspiring. \n00:07:30 Speaker 2 \nIt it doesn’t mean anything in this sense of giving motivation. You always need to tell them some kind of fiction fantasy and the people who invent the fictions are far more powerful than the people who know the facts, physics. \n00:07:50 Speaker 2 \nIn Iran today, the nuclear physicists are getting their orders from people who are experts in Shiite. \n00:07:58 Speaker 2 \nIn Israel, increasingly, the physicists in the Soviet Union, they got it from Communist ideologues Germany. \n00:08:12 Speaker 2 \nIt’s usually the people who know how to read the story that give orders to the people who merely know. \n00:08:20 Speaker 2 \nFacts of of of Nuclear Physics and one last point crucial point is that when if you build the bomb and ignore the fact of physics, the bomb will not explode. But if you build a story and ignore the facts of history and biology and whatever, the story still explodes. \n00:08:41 Speaker 2 \nAnd usually with a much bigger bank. \n00:08:44 Speaker 1 \nAnd so one of the underlying conceits of this book. \n00:08:49 Speaker 1 \nIn my mind, as a reader is that you believe that AI is going to be used for these purposes? \n00:08:54 \nYeah. \n00:08:56 Speaker 1 \nAnd that AI ultimately is going to be used as a storyteller to tell untruths and unwise stories, and that those who have the power behind this AI are going to be able to use it in this way. Do you believe it’s that people are going to use the AI? \n00:09:15 Speaker 1 \nIn the wrong way, or that the AI is going to use the AI in the wrong way? \n00:09:21 Speaker 2 \nInitially it will be the. \n00:09:22 Speaker 2 \nPeople. But if we are not careful, it will get out of our control and it will be the AI. I mean, maybe we start by saying something about the definition of of AI, because it’s now kind of this buzzword which is everywhere and there is so much hype around it that it’s becoming difficult to understand what it is. \n00:09:41 Speaker 2 \nWhenever they try to sell you something, especially in the financial markets, they tell you it’s an AI. This is an AI chair and this is an AI table. And this is an AI coffee machine. So buy it. \n00:09:53 Speaker 2 \nAnd So what is AI? So if you take a coffee machine as an example, not every automatic machine is an AI, even though it knows how to make coffee. When you press a button, it’s not an AI. \n00:10:07 Speaker 2 \nIt’s simply doing whatever it was pre programmed by humans to do for something to be an AI, it needs the ability to learn and change by itself. \n00:10:19 Speaker 2 \nAnd ultimately to make decisions and create new ideas by itself. So if you approach the coffee machine and the coffee machine on its own accord tells you, hey, good morning, Andrew. I’ve been watching you for the last couple of weeks. And based on everything I learned about you and your facial expression and then the hour of the day and whatever. \n00:10:41 Speaker 2 \nI predict that you would like an espresso, so here I made you an espresso. Then it’s an AI and it’s really an AI. If it says an actually, I’ve just invented a new drink called best Pretzel, which is even better. I think you would like it better for it took the liberty to make some for you. \n00:11:02 Speaker 2 \nWhen it can make decisions and create new ideas by itself. \n00:11:06 Speaker 2 \nAnd once you create something like that, then obviously the potential for it to get out of control and to start manipulating you is there and that’s the big issue. \n00:11:21 Speaker 1 \nAnd so how far away do you think we are from that? \n00:11:28 Speaker 2 \nWhen Openai developed GPT 4 like two years ago, they did all kinds of tests. What can this thing do? So one of the tests they gave are GPD for was to solve capture puzzles that. \n00:11:44 Speaker 2 \nWhen you access. \n00:11:45 Speaker 2 \nA web page, a bank, or something you may want to know. \n00:11:48 Speaker 2 \nYou’re a human being, or you’re a bot, so you are. You have these twisted letters and symbols. \n00:11:53 Speaker 1 \nAnd this is or the 9 squares and it says which one has something with four legs in it and you see the animal and click the animal. \n00:11:54 Speaker 2 \nYeah. \n00:11:59 Speaker 2 \nAll these kinds of things. \n00:12:00 Speaker 2 \nYeah. \n00:12:02 Speaker 2 \nAnd GPT 4 couldn’t solve it. But GPD 4 access. \n00:12:07 Speaker 2 \nTask Rabbit, which is an online site where you can hire people to do. \n00:12:13 Speaker 2 \nAll kinds of things for you. \n00:12:15 Speaker 2 \nAnd you know, these captures were developed so humans can solve them. But AI, I still struggle with. \n00:12:22 Speaker 2 \nSo it wanted to hire a human. That’s interesting. The human got suspicious. \n00:12:31 Speaker 2 \nThe human asked why do you need somebody to solve the culture? Puzzles are. \n00:12:36 Speaker 2 \nYou a robot? \n00:12:39 Speaker 2 \nAnd at that point, GPT 4 said no, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment, which is why I have difficulty with these captures. \n00:12:49 Speaker 1 \nSo and how to lie? \n00:12:51 Speaker 2 \nIt it had basically theory of mind. On some level it it it knew what you know. There’s so many different explanations. \n00:12:59 Speaker 2 \nAnd lies you. \n00:13:00 Speaker 2 \nCan tell, he told a very, very effective lie. \n00:13:03 Speaker 2 \nIt’s the kind of life that occupation improve, but I’m not going to ask any more questions about it. I will just take the word of GPT for for it. \n00:13:14 Speaker 2 \nAnd nobody told it to lie, and nobody told it. Which lie will be most effective? It landed. \n00:13:22 Speaker 2 \nThe same way that humans and animals learn things by interacting. \n00:13:27 Speaker 2 \nWith the world. \n00:13:30 Speaker 1 \nLet me ask you a different. \n00:13:31 Speaker 1 \nQuestion. To the extent that. \n00:13:33 Speaker 1 \nYou believe that the computer will be able to do this to us. \n00:13:38 Speaker 3 \nWill with the. \n00:13:38 Speaker 1 \nHelp of the computer we be able to avoid these problems on the other side, meaning there’s a cat and mouse game here and and the question is between the human and the computer together, will we be able to be more powerful and maybe power or is good or bad but be able to get at truth? \n00:13:46 Speaker 2 \nThen. \n00:14:00 Speaker 1 \nIn a better way. \n00:14:02 Speaker 2 \nPotentially yes. I mean the the point of talking about it, of writing a book about it is that it’s not too late and that also the AI’s are not inherently evil or malevolent. It’s a question of how we shape this technology. We still have the power. \n00:14:20 Speaker 2 \nWe are still at the present moment. We are still far more powerful than the AIS. They in very narrow domains like playing chess or playing golf. They are becoming more intelligent than us, but we still have a huge edge. Nobody knows for how many more years, so we need to use it and make sure that we direct the development of this technology. \n00:14:43 Speaker 2 \nAre in in a safe. \n00:14:44 Speaker 2 \nDirection. OK, so. \n00:14:45 Speaker 1 \nI’m going to make you king for the day. \n00:14:48 Speaker 1 \nWhat would you do? How would you? Would you regulate these things? How what? What is it exactly in? \n00:14:53 Speaker 1 \nIn an environment. \n00:14:54 Speaker 1 \nAnd world where we don’t have global regulators, we don’t have people who like to interact and even talk to each other anymore. Frankly, where we’ve talked about regulating social media, at least in the United States for the past 15 years now. \n00:15:08 Speaker 1 \nAnd have done next to nothing. \n00:15:11 Speaker 1 \nHow we would get there, what that looks like? \n00:15:14 Speaker 2 \nYou know, there are many regulations we should enact right now and we can talk about that. One key regulation is make social media corporations liable for the actions of their algorithms, not for the actions of their users and for the. \n00:15:30 Speaker 2 \nSections of the the corporate algorithms and another key regulation that AIS cannot pretend to be human beings. They can interact with us only if they identify as AIS. But beyond all these specific regulations, the key thing is institutions. \n00:15:51 Speaker 2 \nNobody is able to predict. \n00:15:54 Speaker 2 \nHow this is going to play out, how this is going to develop in the next 5-10, fifty years? So any any thought that we can now kind of regulate in advance it’s it’s impossible. No rigid regulation will be able to deal with what we are facing. We need living institutions. \n00:16:15 Speaker 2 \nThat have the best human talent and also the best technology. \n00:16:19 Speaker 2 \nThat can identify problems as they develop and react on the fly, and we are living in an era in which there is growing hostility towards institutions. But what we’ve learned again and again throughout history, is that all institutions are able to deal with these things, not single. \n00:16:39 Speaker 2 \nIndividuals and not some kind of miracle regulations. \n00:16:44 Speaker 1 \nPlay it out. What is the the and and you play it out in the book a little bit when it comes to dictators and your real fears. What is the your worst case fear about? \n00:16:45 \nOK. \n00:16:55 Speaker 1 \nAll of this. \n00:16:58 Speaker 2 \nOne of the problems with AI is that there isn’t just like this single nightmare scenario with nuclear weapons. One of the good things about nuclear weapons it it was very easy for everybody to understand the danger, because there was basically one extremely dangerous scenario. \n00:17:18 Speaker 2 \nNuclear war. \n00:17:20 Speaker 2 \nWith AIS, because they are, they are not tools like atom bombs, they are agents. \n00:17:27 Speaker 2 \nThat that’s the most important thing to understand about them. An atom bomb, ultimately, is a tool in our hand. All decisions about how to use it and how to develop it. Humans make these decisions. \n00:17:40 Speaker 2 \nAI is not a tool in our hand. It’s an autonomous agent. \n00:17:46 Speaker 2 \nThat, as I said, can make decisions and can invent ideas by itself, and therefore by definition, there are hundreds of dangerous scenarios that are many of them we cannot predict because they are coming from a non human intelligence. \n00:18:06 Speaker 2 \nBut think differently than us. \n00:18:10 Speaker 2 \nYou know the the acronym AI. It traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it should stand for alien intelligence. Not in the sense that coming from outer space in the sense that it’s an alien kind of intelligence, it thinks. \n00:18:26 Speaker 2 \nDifferently than a human being, and it’s not artificial because an artifact, again, is something that we create and. \n00:18:34 Speaker 2 \nSmall and this is now as the potential to go way beyond what we can predict and control still from all the different scenarios, the one which I think are speaks to to my deepest fears and also to to humanity’s deepest fears is. \n00:18:54 Speaker 2 \nBeing trapped. \n00:18:56 Speaker 2 \nIn a world of delusions created by AI, you know the fear of robots rebelling against humans and shooting people and whatever. This is very new. This goes back a couple of decades, maybe to the mid 20th. \n00:19:13 Speaker 2 \nBut for thousands of years, humans have been haunted by a much deeper fear. We know that our societies are ultimately based on stories. \n00:19:24 Speaker 2 \nAnd there was always the fear that we will just be trapped inside the world of illusions and delusions and fantasies, which we mistake for reality. \n00:19:37 Speaker 2 \nAnd will not be able to escape from, but will lose all touch with truth with reality. \n00:19:43 Speaker 1 \nPart of that exists today. \n00:19:44 Speaker 2 \nYeah. And, you know, it goes back to the parable of The Cave in Platos to losophy of a group of prisoners chained in a cave facing a blank wall, a screen. \n00:19:59 Speaker 2 \nAnd there are shadows projected on this screen and they mistake the shadows for reality. And you have the same fears in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy of the world of Maya. The world of illusions. And AI is kind of the perfect tool. \n00:20:18 Speaker 2 \nTo create it. \n00:20:19 Speaker 2 \nWe are already seeing it being created all around. \n00:20:23 Speaker 2 \nIf the main metaphor of the early Internet age was the web, the World Wide Web and the web connects everything. So now the main metaphor is the cocoon. It’s the web which closes on us, and I live inside 1 information. \n00:20:43 Speaker 2 \nAnd you live inside maybe a different information cocoon and there is absolutely no way for us to communicate because we live in separate different reality. \n00:20:55 Speaker 1 \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies, and let me read you something from the book because I think it speaks to maybe even this election here in the United States, the definition of democracy as a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms stands in sharp contrast to a common misconception. \n00:21:15 Speaker 1 \nThat equates democracy only with elections. \n00:21:20 Speaker 1 \nElections are a central part of the Democratic toolkit, but they are not democracy. In the absence of additional self correcting mechanisms, elections can easily be rigged. Even if the elections are completely free and fair by itself, this too doesn’t guarantee democracy for democracy is not the same thing as. And this one’s interesting. \n00:21:41 Speaker 1 \nMajority dictatorship. \n00:21:44 Speaker 1 \nWhat do you? \n00:21:44 Speaker 1 \nBye, Matt. \n00:21:46 Speaker 2 \nWhat many things, but I mean on the most basic level, just so in Venezuela that you can hold elections and if the dictator has the power to rig the elections, so it means nothing. \n00:22:01 Speaker 2 \nThe great advantage of democracy is that it corrects itself. \n00:22:06 Speaker 2 \nIt has this mechanism that you try something, but people try something. They vote for a party for a leader. Let’s try this bunch of policies for a couple of years. If it doesn’t work well, we can now try something else. \n00:22:20 Speaker 2 \nThat the the basic ability to say we made the mistake, let’s try something else. This is democracy. In putting Russia, you cannot say that we made a mistake. Let’s let’s try somebody else in democracy. You can. But there is a problem here. You give so much power for limited time. You give so much power. \n00:22:41 Speaker 2 \nTo a leader, to a party. \n00:22:44 Speaker 2 \nTo enact certain policies. But then what happens is that leader or party utilizes the power that the people gave them not to enact a specific time limited policy, but to gain even more power and to make it impossible to get rid of them anymore. \n00:23:03 Speaker 2 \nIt was always one of the key problems of democracy that you can use democracy to gain power and then use the power you have to destroy democracy. Everyone said it in in Turkey, I think best that, he said. Democracy is like a tram, like a. \n00:23:20 Speaker 2 \nTrain you take it until you reach the destination, then you go down. You don’t stay on the train. \n00:23:31 Speaker 2 \nAh. \n00:23:37 Speaker 2 \nAnd. \n00:23:39 Speaker 2 \nFor most of history, large scale democracy was really impossible because democracy in essence is a conversation between a large number of people. \n00:23:52 Speaker 2 \nAnd in the ancient world, you could have this conversation in a tribe, in a village, in a city state like Athens or Republican Rome. But you could not have it in a large Kingdom with millions of people because there was no technical means to hold the conversation. So we don’t know of any example. \n00:24:13 Speaker 2 \nOf a large scale democracy before the rise of modern information technology in the late modern age, so democracy is built on top of information tech. \n00:24:24 Speaker 2 \nLogic and when there is a big change in information technology like what is happening right now in the world, there was an earthquake. \n00:24:34 Speaker 2 \nIn the structure built on top of it. \n00:24:36 Speaker 1 \nWho was supposed to be the arbiter of truth in these democracies? And the reason I raised this issue is we we have a big debate going on in this country right now about free speech and how much information we’re supposed to know what access to information we’re supposed to get. \n00:24:47 Speaker 2 \nYeah. \n00:24:54 Speaker 1 \nMark Zuckerberg just came out a couple weeks ago and said that, you know, there was information during the pandemic that he was suppressing that in retrospect, he wishes now he wasn’t suppressing. \n00:25:06 Speaker 2 \nMm-hmm. \n00:25:07 Speaker 1 \nThis gets to the idea of truth, and it also gets to the idea of what information you said. Information is not. \n00:25:12 Speaker 1 \nTruth, yeah. \n00:25:14 Speaker 1 \nAre we supposed to get access to all of it and decipher what’s real ourselves? Is somebody else supposed to do it for us? And will AI? \n00:25:23 Speaker 1 \nUltimately, be that arbiter. \n00:25:26 Speaker 2 \nSo there are a couple of of of of different questions here, one about free speech and the other about who is supposed to most important thing is that free speech includes the freedom to tell lies, to tell fictions, to tell fantasies. So it’s not the same as the question of truth. \n00:25:47 Speaker 2 \nIdeally, in the democracy you also have the. \n00:25:49 Speaker 2 \nFreedom to lie. \n00:25:51 Speaker 2 \nYou also have the freedom to spread directions. \n00:25:53 Speaker 1 \nThe ideal is why is that ideal? \n00:26:00 Speaker 2 \nAnd and this is something that is crucial to understand, because the tech giants, they are constantly confusing the question of truth with the question of free speech. And there are two different questions. \n00:26:14 Speaker 2 \nWe don’t want a kind of truth police that constantly tells human beings what they can and cannot say. \n00:26:23 Speaker 2 \nThere are, of course limits even to that, but ideally yes, people should be able to also tell fictions and fantasies and so forth. \n00:26:34 Speaker 2 \nThis is information, it’s not true. \n00:26:37 Speaker 2 \nThe crucial role. \n00:26:40 Speaker 2 \nOf this feeling out of this ocean of information. \n00:26:44 Speaker 2 \nThe rare and costly kind of information, which is truth. \n00:26:50 Speaker 2 \nThis is the role of several different, very important institutions in society. This is the role of scientists. This is the role of journalists. This is the role of judges. \n00:27:02 Speaker 2 \nAnd the role or the aim of these institutions is not to limit the freedom of speech of the of the people, but to tell us what is the truth. Now the problem we now face is that there is a sustained. \n00:27:22 Speaker 2 \nAttack. \n00:27:23 Speaker 2 \nOn these institutions and on the very notion that there is truth because the dominant worldview in large parts of both the left and the right on the left takes a mouse’s shape, and on the right the populist shape. \n00:27:42 Speaker 2 \nThey tell us that the only reality is power. \n00:27:49 Speaker 2 \nAll, all the world, all the universe, all reality is just power. The only thing humans want humans want is power and any human interaction like we have in this conversation is just a power struggle. And in every such interaction, when somebody tells you something. \n00:28:10 Speaker 2 \nThe question to ask, and this is what Donald Trump meets Karl Marx, and they shake hands. They agree on that when somebody tells you something, the question to ask is not what is. Is it true? There is no such thing. The question to ask is who is winning and who is losing? \n00:28:29 Speaker 2 \nWhose privileges like what I have just said, whose privileges are being served by. \n00:28:36 Speaker 2 \nAnd the idea is that when scientists, journalists, judges, people at large, they are only in pursuing power. And this is an extremely cynical and destructive view which undermines all institutions. \n00:28:55 Speaker 2 \nLuckily, it’s not true. \n00:28:59 Speaker 2 \nEspecially when we look at ourselves, if we start to understand humanity just by looking at ourselves, most people will say yes, I want some power in life, but it’s not the only thing I want. I actually want truth. Also, I want to know the truth about myself, about my life. \n00:29:19 Speaker 2 \nThe truth about the world, and the reason that there is this deep yearning for truth, is that you can’t really be happy. \n00:29:28 Speaker 2 \nIf you don’t know the truth about yourself and about your life, if you look at these, people are obsessed with power. People like Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump, they have a lot of power. They don’t seem to be particularly happy. \n00:29:47 Speaker 2 \nAnd when you realize that I’m a human being and I I really want to know at least some truth about life, why isn’t it true also of others? \n00:29:59 Speaker 2 \nAnd yes, there are problems in institutions. There are, there is corruption, there is influence. And so. But This is why we have a lot of different institutions. \n00:30:08 Speaker 1 \nI’m going to throw another name at you. You talked about Putin, you talked about Trump, you talked about Netanyahu. He’s not a politician, but he might want to be some. \n00:30:16 Speaker 1 \nPoint. \n00:30:17 Speaker 1 \nElon Musk. \n00:30:18 \nHmm. \n00:30:20 Speaker 1 \nWhere do you put him in this? And the reason I ask? Talking about truth and information, he’s somebody who said that he wants to set all information free because he believes that if the information is free, he says that you, all of us, will be able to find and get to the. \n00:30:36 Speaker 1 \nTruth, there are others. \n00:30:37 Speaker 2 \nMHM. \n00:30:38 Speaker 1 \nWho believe that all of that information. \n00:30:40 Speaker 1 \nIt will obscure the truth. \n00:30:42 Speaker 2 \nI think that it’s a very naive view of information and truth. The idea that you just open the floodgates and let information flood the world and the truth will somehow rise to the top. \n00:30:57 Speaker 2 \nYou don’t know anything about history. If this is what? \n00:31:00 Speaker 2 \nYou think? \n00:31:03 Speaker 2 \nIt just doesn’t work like that. The truth? Again, it’s costly. It’s well, like, if you want to write a true story in the newspaper or an academic paper or whatever, you have to research so much. It’s very difficult. \n00:31:19 Speaker 2 \nTakes a lot of time, energy, money. If you want to create some fiction, it’s the easiest thing in the world. \n00:31:26 Speaker 2 \nSimilarly, the truth is often very complicated because reality is very complicated, whereas fiction and fantasy can be made as simple as possible, and people in most cases they like simple stories and the truth is often painful. Whether you think about and the truth about entire countries. \n00:31:41 Speaker 1 \nRight. \n00:31:47 Speaker 2 \nOr the truth about individuals. The truth is often unattractive. It’s painful. We don’t want to know. For instance, the pain that we inflict sometimes on people in our life or on ourselves. \n00:32:03 Speaker 2 \nBecause the truth is, is costly and it’s complicated and it can be painful in a completely kind of free fight. It will lose. This is why we need institutions. \n00:32:16 Speaker 2 \nLike newspapers or like academic institutions, and once again something very important about the tech giants. \n00:32:25 Speaker 2 \nMy problem with Facebook and and and Twitter and so forth. I don’t expect them to censor their users. We have to be very, very careful about censoring the expression of real human beings. \n00:32:41 Speaker 2 \nMy problem is the algorithms. Yes, even the even when they’re not telling the truth, we’re very careful about censoring the the the, the free expression of human beings. My problem is with the algorithms. \n00:32:42 Speaker 1 \nEven when they’re telling the truth, even when they’re telling untruths. \n00:32:57 Speaker 2 \nThat if you look at the historical case, like the massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar in 20/16/2017, in which thousands of of people were murdered, 10s of thousands were raped, and hundreds of thousands were expelled and are still refugees in Bangladesh and elsewhere. \n00:33:18 Speaker 2 \nThis ethnic cleansing campaign was fueled by a propaganda campaign that are generated intense hatred among Buddhists, bunnies in Myanmar against the Rohingya. \n00:33:33 Speaker 2 \nNow this campaign to a large extent took place on Facebook. \n00:33:40 Speaker 2 \nAnd the Facebook algorithms played a very central role in it. Now, whenever these accusations have been made and they have been made by amnesty in the United Nations and so forth. \n00:33:52 Speaker 2 \nFacebook basically said, but we don’t want to censor the free expression of people that all these conspiracy theories about the Rohingya, that they are all terrorists and they want to destroy us. They were created by human beings. \n00:34:07 Speaker 2 \nAnd who are we? Facebook. The fans of them. And the problem there is that the role of the algorithms. \n00:34:17 Speaker 2 \nWas at that point was not in creating the stories, it was in disseminating in spreading particular stories, because people in Myanmar were creating a lot of different kinds of content. In 20/16/2017, the war hate filled conspiracy theories, but there are also sermons on compassion. \n00:34:40 Speaker 2 \nIn cooking lessons and biology lessons and so much content. \n00:34:44 Speaker 2 \nAnd in the battle between for human attention, what will get the attention of the users in Myanmar, the algorithms of the Kingmakers and the algorithms were given by Facebook. \n00:35:00 Speaker 2 \nA clear and simple goal. Increase user engagement. \n00:35:07 Speaker 2 \nKeep more people, more time on the platform because this is the basis for once still is for, for Facebook. \n00:35:15 Speaker 2 \n’S business model. \n00:35:17 Speaker 2 \nNow the algorithms and this goes back to AIS that make decisions by themselves and invent ideas by themselves. Nobody in Facebook wanted them to be an ethnic cleansing campaign. \n00:35:30 Speaker 2 \nMost of them didn’t know anything about Myanmar and what was happening there. They just told the algorithms, increased user engagement, and the algorithms experimented on millions of human Guinea pigs. And they discovered that if you press the hate button and the seal but. \n00:35:47 Speaker 2 \nIn the human mind, you keep that human glued to the screen, so they deliberately started spreading hate filled conspiracy theories and not. \n00:35:59 Speaker 2 \nCooking lessons or summers on on compassion and this is the expectation, don’t censor. \n00:36:06 Speaker 2 \nThe users, but if your algorithms deliberately spread hate and fear because this is your business model, it’s on you. This is your fault. \n00:36:18 Speaker 1 \nOK. But I’m gonna make it more complicated. I’m going to make it more complicated. And the reason we we’re talking about Facebook and and Elon Musk. \n00:36:25 Speaker 1 \nIs that the algorithms that are effectively building these new AI agents are scraping all of this information. \n00:36:36 Speaker 1 \nOff of these sites, this human user generated content which we’ve decided everybody should be able to see, except once the AI’s see it, they will see the conspiracy theories. They will see the misinformation and the question is how the AI agent will ever learn what’s real and what’s not. \n00:36:57 Speaker 2 \nThat is a very, very old question that you know the editor of. \n00:37:02 Speaker 2 \nThe New York. \n00:37:03 Speaker 2 \nTimes the editor of the Wall Street Journal have dealt with this question before. Why do we need to start again? As if there has never been any history? \n00:37:14 Speaker 2 \nLike the question, there is so much information out there. How should I know what’s true or not? \n00:37:20 Speaker 2 \nPeople have been there before. If you run Twitter or Facebook, you are running one of the biggest media companies in the world, so take a look at what media companies have been dealing with in the previous generations and previous centuries. It’s basic. \n00:37:35 Speaker 1 \nThey should be liable for what’s on their sites right now. \n00:37:39 Speaker 2 \nThe the tech companies. \n00:37:40 Speaker 1 \nThe tech companies should be liable for for the user generated content. \n00:37:42 Speaker 2 \nThey should be. \n00:37:43 Speaker 2 \nLiable. No, they should be liable for the actions of their algorithms. \n00:37:48 Speaker 2 \nIf their algorithms decided to put at the top of the news feed a hate filled conspiracy theory, it’s on them not on the person who created the conspiracy theory in the 1st place. The same way that you know, like the chief editor of the New York Times, designed to put a hateful conspiracy theory at the top of the of the first page of the New York Times. \n00:38:10 Speaker 2 \nAnd when you come and and tell them what have you done, they say I haven’t done anything. I didn’t write it. I just decided to put it on the front page of the New York Times. That’s all. That’s not. That’s a huge thing. Editors have a lot more power than the authors to create the. \n00:38:30 Speaker 2 \nVery cheap to create content. The really key point is what gets the attention. You know, I’ll give you an example from thousands of years ago. \n00:38:40 Speaker 2 \nThat when Christianity began. \n00:38:43 Speaker 2 \nThere were so many. \n00:38:44 Speaker 2 \nStories circulating about Jesus and about the disciples and about the Saint. Anybody could invent a story in that, Jesus said. \n00:38:53 Speaker 2 \nAnd there was no Bible. \n00:38:56 Speaker 2 \nThere was no New Testament in the time of Jesus or 100 years after Jesus or even 200 years after Jesus. \n00:39:02 Speaker 2 \nThere are lots and lots of stories and texts and parable. At a certain point. \n00:39:09 Speaker 2 \nThe leaders of the Christian Church in the 4th century, they said this cannot go on like this. We have to have some order in this flood of information. How would Christians know what information to value, which texts to read and what are forgeries of whatever that they should just ignore? \n00:39:29 Speaker 2 \nAnd their hands are two church councils in Hippo and in Carthage today in Tunisia in the late 4th century. And this is where they they didn’t write the texts. The texts were written generations previously, but so many different people. \n00:39:47 Speaker 2 \nThey decided what will get into the Bible and what will stay out. The book didn’t come down from heaven in its coming complete fall. \n00:39:58 Speaker 2 \nThere was a committee that decided which of all the texts will get in and, for instance, they decided that are a text which claimed to be written by Saint Paul. But many scholars today believe that it wasn’t written by Saint Paul. The First Epistle to Timothy. \n00:40:19 Speaker 2 \nWhich was a very misogynistic text which said basically the role of women is to be silent and to build children. This got into the Bible, whereas another text, the acts of Paul and Thecla, which portrayed Sheckler as a disciple of Saint Paul, are preaching and leading the Christian. \n00:40:40 Speaker 2 \nCommunity and doing miracles and so forth. They said. Nah, let’s leave that one out. \n00:40:46 Speaker 2 \nAnd the views of billions of Christians for almost 2000 years. \n00:40:53 Speaker 2 \nAbout women and their capacities and their role in the church in the community, it was decided and not by the authors of First Timothy and the Act of politics. \n00:41:08 Speaker 2 \nBut by this church committee, who sat in what is today Tunisia and went over all these things and decided this will be in, and this will be out, this is enormous power. The power of curation, the editorial power, you know, you think about the the role of newspapers in, in, in, in modern politics. \n00:41:29 Speaker 2 \nIt’s the editors who have the most power learning before he was dictator of the Soviet Union is one job, was chief editor of Isra. \n00:41:39 Speaker 2 \nAnd Mussolini also first was a journalist when he was editor. \n00:41:44 Speaker 2 \nImmense power and now the editors increasingly are the algorithms. You know, I’m here partly on. \n00:41:51 Speaker 2 \nThe book too. \n00:41:53 Speaker 2 \nAnd I know that my number one customer. \n00:41:56 Speaker 2 \nIs is the algorithm? \n00:41:58 Speaker 2 \nLike if I can get the algorithm to recommend my book, the humans will follow. \n00:42:06 Speaker 2 \nSo is it an immense power? \n00:42:09 Speaker 2 \nAnd. \n00:42:11 Speaker 2 \nThat’s above my pay grade. I mean, I’m just sitting here on the stage talking with you. \n00:42:19 Speaker 2 \nWe’ll do this. We’ll do that, we’ll. \n00:42:21 Speaker 2 \nPut it like this. \n00:42:25 Speaker 2 \nRealize the immense power of the recommendation algorithm. The editor this comes with responsibility. \n00:42:32 Speaker 2 \nSo then I don’t think that we should hold Twitter or Facebook responsible for what the users, right. And we should be very careful about censoring users even when they say when they write lines. But we should hold the companies responsible for the choices. \n00:42:53 Speaker 2 \nAnd the decisions of their algorithms. \n00:42:55 Speaker 1 \nYou talked now about Lenin, and we’ve talked about all sorts of dictators. One of the things. \n00:42:59 Speaker 1 \nYou talk about in the book is the prospect. \n00:43:02 Speaker 1 \nThat AI could be used to turn a democracy into totalitarian state? Yeah, I thought was fascinating. \n00:43:11 Speaker 1 \nBecause it would really require AI to cocoon all of us in a unique way, telling some kind of story that captures an entire country. How would that work in your mind? \n00:43:25 Speaker 2 \nAnd then we don’t see reality. We see the information. \n00:43:30 Speaker 2 \nThat we are exposed. \n00:43:32 Speaker 2 \nAnd if you have better technology to to create and to control information, you have a much more powerful technology to control humans. \n00:43:45 Speaker 2 \nPreviously, there was always limitations to how much a central authority could control what people see and think and do. Even if you think about the most totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. \n00:44:01 Speaker 2 \nLike the US saw or Nazi Germany, they couldn’t really follow everybody all the time. It was technically impossible. Like if you have 200 million Soviet citizens to follow them around all the time, 24 hours a day, you need about 400 million KGB. \n00:44:21 Speaker 2 \nAgents because even KGB agents need to sleep. Sometimes they need to eat. Sometimes they need 2 shifts. So 200 million citizens. You need 400 million. \n00:44:29 Speaker 2 \nAgents you don’t. \n00:44:29 Speaker 2 \nHave 400 million KGB agents, even if you. \n00:44:33 Speaker 2 \nYou still have a bigger problem because let’s say that two agents follow each citizen 24 hours a day. What are they doing? The end, they write a report. This is like 1940 or 1960. It’s paper. They write a paper report. So every day KGB headquarters in Moscow is flooded. \n00:44:52 Speaker 2 \nWith 200 million reports about each citizen where they went, what they read, who they meant, somebody needs to analyze all the information they where do they get the analysts? It’s absolutely impossible, which is why even in the Soviet Union. \n00:45:10 Speaker 2 \nPrivacy will feel the default. \n00:45:13 Speaker 2 \nYou never knew who is watching and who is listening, but most of the time nobody was watching and listening. And even if they were, most likely the report about you would be buried in some place in the archives of the KGB. Nobody would ever read it. \n00:45:28 Speaker 2 \nNow both problems of surveillance are solved by AI to follow all the people of the country 24 hours a day, you do not need millions of human agents. You have all these digital agents, the smartphones, the computers, the microphones and so forth. \n00:45:47 Speaker 2 \nYou can put the whole population under 24 hour surveillance and you don’t need human analysts to analyze all the information you have. \n00:45:56 Speaker 2 \nAI INS to do it? \n00:45:57 Speaker 1 \nWhat do you make of the idea that an entire generation has given up on? \n00:46:02 Speaker 1 \nThe idea of privacy. \n00:46:05 Speaker 1 \nRight. We all put our pictures on Instagram and Facebook and all of these sites we hear about a security hack at some website and we go back the next day and try to buy and put our credit card on the same site again. We say that we’re very anxious about privacy. We we. \n00:46:23 Speaker 2 \nWe love to. \n00:46:23 Speaker 1 \nTell people how anxious we are about the. \n00:46:26 Speaker 1 \nAnd then we do things that are the complete opposite. \n00:46:30 Speaker 2 \nBecause there is. \n00:46:30 Speaker 2 \nImmense pressure on us to do them. \n00:46:34 Speaker 2 \nPart of it is is despair. \n00:46:37 Speaker 2 \nAnd people still cherish privacy and part of the problem is that we haven’t seen the consequences yet yet yet we will see them quite soon. It’s like this huge experiment conducted on billions of of human Guinea pigs, but we still haven’t seen the consequences of this. \n00:46:57 Speaker 2 \nAnnihilation. \n00:46:59 Speaker 2 \nOf privacy and it is extremely, extremely dangerous. Again, going back to the freedom of speech issue, part of this crisis of freedom of speech is the erosion of the difference between private and public. \n00:47:15 Speaker 2 \nThat there is a big difference. If there’s just the two of us are sitting alone somewhere talking just you and me. Or if there is an entire audience and it’s public now, I’m a very big believer in the right to stupidity. People have a right to be stupid in private. \n00:47:35 Speaker 2 \nBut when you talk in private with your best friends, with your family, whatever you have a right to be really stupid, to be offensive as a gay person, I would say that even politicians, if they tell homophobic jokes in a private situation with their friends, this is none of my business. \n00:47:55 Speaker 2 \nAnd it’s actually good that politicians would have situations where they can just relax and say the first stupid thing that pops up in the. \n00:48:06 Speaker 2 \nThis should not happen in public. \n00:48:09 Speaker 1 \nNow it’s going to be entered into the. \n00:48:09 \n1. \n00:48:11 Speaker 2 \nAlgorithm. Yes, and this inability. \n00:48:17 Speaker 2 \nTo know what that anything they say, even in private, cannot go viral. So there is no difference, and this is extremely harmful. Part of what’s happening now in the world is this kind of tension. \n00:48:32 Speaker 2 \nBetween organic animals, we are organic animals and an inorganic digital system which is increasingly controlling and shaping the entire world. Now part of being an organic entity is that you live by cycles, day and night. \n00:48:52 Speaker 2 \nWinter and summer growth and decay. Sometimes you are active, sometimes you need to relax and to rest. \n00:49:00 Speaker 2 \nAre algorithms and AIS and computers? They are not organic, they never need rest. They are on all the time. And the big question is whether we adapt to them or they adapt to us and and more and more. Of course we have to adapt to them. We have to be on all the time. \n00:49:20 Speaker 2 \nThe new cycle is always on and everything we see, even when we are supposedly relaxing with friends, it can be public. So the whole of life becomes like this one long job. \n00:49:33 Speaker 2 \nAny stupid thing you did in some college when you are 18, it can meet you down the road. \n00:49:42 Speaker 2 \nAnd this is destructive. \n00:49:44 Speaker 2 \nTo how we function. We even think about the market like Wall Street. As far as I know, it’s open Monday to Friday is 9:30 to 4:00 in the afternoon, likely from Friday at 5 minutes past four, a new war erupted in the Middle East. The market will react only on Monday. \n00:50:03 Speaker 2 \nIt is still running by organic cycles now. What would happen to human bankers and finance citizens? What is happening when the market is always active? You can never relax. \n00:50:15 Speaker 3 \nWe’ve got some. \n00:50:16 Speaker 1 \nQuestions I think that are going to come out here on, on cards, which I want to ask in just a moment. I have a couple of questions before we get to them. One is, have you talked to folks like Sam Altman who runs open AI or the folks at Microsoft and Know Bill Gates was a big fan of your books in the past or the folks at Google? \n00:50:34 Speaker 1 \nWhat do they say? \n00:50:35 Speaker 1 \nWhen you discuss this with them, and do you trust them as humans when you’ve met them, do you go? I trust you, Sam Altman. \n00:50:45 Speaker 2 \nMost of them are afraid they understand. \n00:50:48 Speaker 1 \nAfraid of you or afraid of AI? \n00:50:50 Speaker 2 \nAfraid of what? What they are doing? Afraid of what is happening. They understand better than anybody else their potential, including the destructive potential of what they are creating. \n00:51:02 Speaker 2 \nAnd they are very afraid of it. At the same time, their basic stick is that I’m a good guy and I’m very concerned about it. Now you have these other guys, they are bad. They don’t have the same kind of responsibilities that I have. So it would be very bad for humanity if they create it first. So I must be the one. \n00:51:23 Speaker 2 \nOperated first and you can trust me that I will know. I will at least do my best. \n00:51:29 Speaker 2 \nTo to to keep it under and everybody else saying it. And I think that to to some extent they are genuine about it. There is of course also this. \n00:51:39 Speaker 2 \nAnother element in in there of extreme kind of pride and hubris, but they are doing the most important thing in basically not just the history of humanity, the history of life. \n00:51:52 Speaker 1 \nDo you think they are? \n00:51:54 Speaker 2 \nThey could be, yes, if you think about the timeline of the universe, at least as far as. \n00:51:59 Speaker 2 \nWe know it. \n00:52:01 Speaker 2 \nSo you have basically two stops. First, stop 4 billion years ago, the first organic life forms in merge on Planet Earth, and then for 4 billion years nothing major happens. Like for four million years. It’s more of the same. It’s more organic stuff. So you have amoebas and you have dinosaurs and you have. \n00:52:23 Speaker 2 \nHumans, but it’s all organic. \n00:52:25 Speaker 2 \nAnd then here comes Elon Musk, or some Altman, and that’s the second important thing in the history of the universe. The beginning of inorganic evolution. \n00:52:36 Speaker 2 \nBecause AI is just the very, very beginning of its evolutionary process, is basically like 10 years or 15 years old. We haven’t seen anything yet deep 4:00 and all these things, they are the amoebas of AI evolution. \n00:52:56 Speaker 2 \nAnd who knows how the AI dinosaurs are going to look like, but the the name. \n00:53:04 Speaker 2 \nOn the inflection point of the history of the universe, if that name is Elon Musk or that name is sent out, one that’s a big thing. \n00:53:15 Speaker 1 \nWe’ve got a a bunch of really great questions and actually one of them is where I wanted to go before we even got to these. So we’re just go straight to it. We’re gonna make. It’s actually a bit of a right turn of a question given the conversation, though, you mentioned that Netanyahu on point. So the question here on the card says you’re Israeli. \n00:53:33 Speaker 1 \nDo you really think that the Israel Palestinian conflict is solvable? \n00:53:38 Speaker 1 \nAnd I thought actually that was an important question because it actually touches on some of these larger issues that you’ve raised about humanity. \n00:53:46 Speaker 2 \nSo on on one level, absolutely yes, it’s not like one of these kind of mathematical problems that we have and mathematical proof that there is no solution to this problem. \n00:53:59 Speaker 2 \nNo, there are all solutions to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It is because it’s not a conflict about objective reality. \n00:54:07 Speaker 2 \nIt’s not a conflict about land or food or resources that you say, OK, there is just not enough food. Somebody have to starve to death or there is not enough land. Somebody has to be thrown in. \n00:54:20 Speaker 2 \nSee, this is not the case. There is enough food between the Mediterranean and Jordan to feed everybody. There is enough energy. There is even enough land. Yes, it’s a very crowded place, but technically there is enough space to build houses and synagogues and mosques and factories and hospitals and schools for everybody. So there is no objective. \n00:54:42 Speaker 2 \nVoltage. But you have people each in their own information cocoon, each with their own mass delusion, each with their own fantasy, are basically denying either the existence of the other side or the right of the other side to exist. \n00:55:01 Speaker 2 \nAnd the war is basically an attempt. \n00:55:06 Speaker 2 \nTo make the other side disappear, like my mind, there’s no space in it. It’s not that the land has no space for the people. My mind has no space in it for the other people. So I will try to make them disappear the same way they don’t exist in my mind. They also must not exist. \n00:55:27 Speaker 2 \nIn reality. \n00:55:28 Speaker 2 \nAnd this is on both sides. \n00:55:31 Speaker 2 \nAnd again, it’s not an objective problem. \n00:55:34 Speaker 2 \nIt’s a problem of what is inside the minds of people, and therefore there there is a solution to it. Unfortunately, there is no motivation. \n00:55:43 Speaker 1 \nWhat is the solution? \n00:55:45 Speaker 1 \nFor someone who grew up there who’s lived there? \n00:55:48 Speaker 1 \nYou’re. You’re not there right now. \n00:55:49 Speaker 1 \nRight, I’m here, right? \n00:55:50 Speaker 1 \nNow you’re here right now. \n00:55:51 Speaker 2 \nYeah. \n00:55:54 \nNo. \n00:55:55 Speaker 2 \nAgain, if you go back, say, to the two state solution, it’s it’s completely workable solution in objective terms. \n00:56:05 Speaker 2 \nAnd you can divide the land and you can divide the resources so that side by side you have a Palestinian state and you have an Israel and Israel and they are both. They both exist and they are both viable and they both provide security and prosperity and dignity to their citizens, to their inhabitants. \n00:56:24 Speaker 1 \nHow how would you? How would you do that though, because part of the part of the issue is is a chicken and egg issue here, it seems like where the Israelis or Netanyahu would say, look, unless we are fully secure and we feel completely good about our security, we can’t really even. \n00:56:25 \nWhat? \n00:56:41 Speaker 1 \nEntertain a conversation just about anything else, right? And the. \n00:56:45 Speaker 1 \nPalestinians on the. \n00:56:46 Speaker 1 \nOther side effectively say the opposite, which is to say that we need. \n00:56:50 Speaker 1 \nYou you need to. \n00:56:50 Speaker 1 \nSolve our our our issues here. \n00:56:52 Speaker 2 \nBoth sides of the problems both sides are right. Each side thinks that the other side is trying to annihilate it, and both are right. This is the problem. \n00:57:02 Speaker 1 \nAnd both are right, but tell them that’s. \n00:57:04 Speaker 1 \nA problem if both are right. \n00:57:11 Speaker 2 \nOur minds it’s very difficult to change the minds of other people, the first crucial. \n00:57:16 Speaker 2 \nThat is to say, these are the people. They exist, and they have the right to exist. \n00:57:25 Speaker 2 \nThe issue is that both sides suspect that they don’t think that we should exist any compromise that they would make is just because they are now a bit weak. \n00:57:38 Speaker 2 \nSo they will are willing to compromise on something, but deep in their hearts they think we should not exist, so that sooner or later, when they are stronger, when they have the opportunity, they will destroy us. And again, this is correct. This is what is in the hearts and minds of both sides. So the place. \n00:57:58 Speaker 2 \nStart is to you know inside first our heads. \n00:58:04 Speaker 2 \nCome to recognize that the other side exists and it has a right to exist that even if someday will have the power to completely annihilate them, we shouldn’t do it because they have a right to exist. And this is something. \n00:58:18 Speaker 2 \nWe can do for us. \n00:58:18 Speaker 1 \nOK, let me ask you, let me ask you a question. \n00:58:21 Speaker 1 \nI think. \n00:58:24 Speaker 1 \nPeople in Israel would say that people in Palestine have a right to exist. \n00:58:28 \nYeah. \n00:58:29 Speaker 1 \nThere is a you don’t believe that you don’t. \n00:58:31 Speaker 1 \nYou think that’s not? \n00:58:32 Speaker 2 \nThe case, unfortunately for a significant percentage of the citizens of Israel and certainly of the members of the present governing coalition, this is not the case. \n00:58:44 Speaker 1 \nAnd you think they have no right to exist? Because I was going to say they would say that they feel that the Palestinians. \n00:58:46 Speaker 2 \nThey. \n00:58:51 Speaker 1 \nWant to annihilate them and do you? \n00:58:54 Speaker 2 \nBelieve that yes, they. And then they think that the Palestinians want to annihilate us and they are right. They do want to annihilate us. But also again, I would say I don’t have the numbers to give you, but a significant part of the Israeli public and a very significant part of the. \n00:59:12 Speaker 2 \nCurrent ruling coalition in Israel, they want to drive the Palestinian completely from from the land. \n00:59:20 Speaker 2 \nAnd maybe they say we are now too weak, so we can’t do it. We have to compromise them only to do a little bit. But ultimately this is what they really think and want and at least some members of the coalition are completely open about it and their messianic fantasy. They actually want a bigger and bigger. \n00:59:41 Speaker 2 \nWar. They want to set the entire Middle East on fire. \n00:59:45 Speaker 2 \nBecause they think that when the smoke would clear, yes, there will be hundreds of thousands of casualties. It will be very difficult. It will be terrible, but in the end we’ll have the entire land to ourselves and there will not be any more Palestinians between the Mediterranean and and the Jordan. \n01:00:03 Speaker 1 \nLet me ask you one other very political question as it relates to this and actually we have a great segue back into our conversation about AI as it happens. \n01:00:12 Speaker 1 \nPolitically here in the US, we have an election. \n01:00:15 Speaker 2 \nMHM. \n01:00:16 Speaker 1 \nAnd there’s some very interesting questions about how former President Trump, if he were to become the president, would be good or bad for Israel. I think there’s a perception that he would be good for Israel. \n01:00:28 Speaker 1 \nYou. \n01:00:28 Speaker 1 \nMay disagree and what you think, Vice President Harris, if she was the president, would be good or bad for Israel, or good or bad. \n01:00:37 Speaker 1 \nFor the Palestinians. \n01:00:39 Speaker 1 \nHow do you see that? \n01:00:40 Speaker 2 \nAnd I I can’t predict what each will decide, but it’s very clear that President Trump is undermining the global order. \n01:00:52 Speaker 2 \nHe’s in favor of chaos. \n01:00:54 Speaker 2 \nHe is in favor of destroying the liberal global order that we had for the previous couple of decades and which provided the with all the problems with all the difficulties, the most peaceful era in human history. \n01:01:14 Speaker 2 \nAnd when you destroy order then you have no alternatives. What you get is chaos. And I don’t think that chaos is good for Israel or that chaos is good for, for the, for the. \n01:01:27 Speaker 2 \nJews for the Jewish people. \n01:01:30 Speaker 2 \nAnd This is why I think that it will be very even from a very kind of transactional, very narrow perspective. You know, America is a long, long way from Israel, from the Middle East. \n01:01:43 Speaker 2 \nAn isolationist America that withdraws from the world order is not good news for Israel. \n01:01:51 Speaker 1 \nSo what do you say to the there are there? Are there are a number of American Jews who say, and I’m Jewish and I I this is not something that I say, but I hear it constantly. They say Trump would be good for the Jews. Trump would be good for Israel. He would protect Israel. \n01:02:06 Speaker 2 \nIn in in what way? \n01:02:11 Speaker 1 \nHe would have a open checkbook and send the military arms and everything that was asked no questions as. \n01:02:19 Speaker 2 \nLong as it serves his interests and if at a particular point it serves his interests to make a deal with Putin or with Iran or with anybody. \n01:02:30 Speaker 2 \nIt is really expense. You will do it. \n01:02:33 Speaker 1 \nFair enough. \n01:02:33 Speaker 2 \nI mean, he’s not committed. \n01:02:38 Speaker 1 \nI asked the question to provoke an answer. Let me ask you. Let me ask you this, and this is a great segue back into the conversation we’ve been having the last hour you’ve written about. \n01:02:47 Speaker 1 \nHuman how humans have evolved to pursue power. \n01:02:52 Speaker 1 \nAnd and knowledge but. \n01:02:53 Speaker 1 \nPower, I think, is the big focus. \n01:02:55 Speaker 1 \nHow does the pursuit? \n01:02:57 Speaker 1 \nOf happiness fit into the narrative. \n01:03:00 Speaker 2 \nHmm. \n01:03:01 Speaker 2 \nAnd I I don’t think that humans are kind of obsessed only with power. I think that power is relatively superficial thing in the human condition. \n01:03:12 Speaker 2 \nIt’s a means to achieve various ends. It’s it’s not necessarily bad, it’s not that power is always bad. No, it can be used for good. It can be used for bad. \n01:03:22 Speaker 2 \nBut the deep motivation of humans, I think, is the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of truth, which are related to one another, because you can never really be happy if you don’t know the truth about yourself, about your life. \n01:03:39 Speaker 2 \nUnfortunately, as often happens, the means becomes an end. \n01:03:45 Speaker 2 \nThat people become obsessed with power, not with what they can do with it. \n01:03:52 Speaker 2 \nThat immense power, and they don’t know what to do with it. All they do with it, very bad things. \n01:03:59 Speaker 1 \nThis is this is an interesting one. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans no longer have relationships with other humans and only have relationships with AI? \n01:04:14 Speaker 2 \nHmm. \n01:04:17 Speaker 2 \nOne thing to say about it is that AI is becoming better and better at understanding our feelings, our emotions, and therefore of developing relationships and intimate relationships with us. Because there is a deep yearning in human beings to be under. \n01:04:34 Speaker 2 \nFood we always want people to understand us, to understand how we feel. We want my husband, my parents, my teachers, my boss, to understand how I feel. And very often we are disappointed. They don’t understand how I, how I feel, partly because they are too preoccupied with their own feelings to care about my feel. \n01:04:55 Speaker 2 \nThanks. \n01:04:56 Speaker 2 \nAI’s will not have this problem. They don’t have any feelings of their own, and they can be 100% focused on deciphering, on analyzing your feelings. \n01:05:10 Speaker 2 \nSo you know, in these all these science fiction movies in which the robots are extremely cold and mechanical and they can’t understand the most basic human emotion. \n01:05:20 Speaker 2 \nIt it’s it’s a complete opposite. \n01:05:23 Speaker 2 \nPart of the issue we are facing is that they will be so good at understanding human emotions and reacting in a way which is exactly calibrated to your personality at this particular moment that we might become exasperated with the human beings. \n01:05:44 Speaker 2 \nWe don’t have this capacity. \n01:05:47 Speaker 2 \nTo understand our emotions and to react in in such. \n01:05:51 Speaker 2 \nA calibrated way. \n01:05:53 Speaker 2 \nThere is a very big question which we didn’t deal with and it it it’s a long question of whether AI’s will develop. \n01:06:00 Speaker 2 \nEmotions, feelings of their own, whether they become conscious or not. At present, we don’t see any sign of it. But even if AI’s don’t develop any feelings of their own, once we become emotionally attached to them. \n01:06:16 Speaker 2 \nIt is likely that we would start treating them as our conscious entities as sentient beings, and will confirm confirm them. The legal status of of persons you know in in the US there is actually a legal path already open for that. \n01:06:36 Speaker 2 \nAre corporations according to U.S. law, are legal persons. They have rights, their freedom of freedom of speech. For instance. Now you can incorporate an AI. \n01:06:47 Speaker 2 \nWhen you incorporate a corporation like Google or Facebook or whatever up and until today, this was to some extent just make believe because all the decisions of the corporations had to be made by human beings, by the executives, the lawyers, the accountants. \n01:07:06 Speaker 2 \nWhat happens if you incorporate an AI? It’s not a legal person, and it can make decisions by itself. It doesn’t need any human team to run it. So you start having legal persons, let’s say in the US, which are not human. \n01:07:22 Speaker 2 \nAnd in many ways are more intelligent than us, and they can start making money, for instance, going on task rabbit and offering their services to various things like writing texts. So they earn money, and then they go to the to to, to, to the market they go to Wall Street and they invest that money. And because they’re so intelligent. \n01:07:42 Speaker 2 \nMaybe they make billions and so you have a situation in which perhaps the richest person. \n01:07:51 Speaker 2 \nIn the US, is not a human being, and part of their rights is that they have honest final speech, the right to make political contributions. \n01:08:02 Speaker 2 \nSo this AI person can contribute billions of dollars to some candidate in exchange for getting more rights to AIS. \n01:08:04 Speaker 1 \nNow lobby is. Where is this going? \n01:08:15 Speaker 1 \nSo there’ll be an AI president. \n01:08:17 Speaker 1 \nI’m hoping you’re going to leave. \n01:08:18 Speaker 1 \nMe. Leave all of us. \n01:08:20 Speaker 1 \nMaybe on a high note here with something optimistic. \n01:08:24 Speaker 1 \nHere’s the question, and it’s my final question. Humans are not always able to think from other perspectives. \n01:08:31 Speaker 1 \nIs AI able to think from multiple perspectives? I think the answer is yes, but do you think that AI will actually help us think this way? \n01:08:35 Speaker 2 \nYeah. \n01:08:43 Speaker 2 \nThat’s one of the positive scenarios about AI that they will help us understand ourselves better. \n01:08:52 Speaker 2 \nThat their immense power will be used not to manipulate us, but to help us. \n01:09:00 Speaker 2 \nAnd then we have historical precedents for that. \n01:09:04 Speaker 2 \nLike we have relationships with our humans, like doctors, like lawyers, accountants, therapists that are know a lot of things about us. \n01:09:16 Speaker 2 \nSome of, like our most private information, is held by these people and they have a fiduciary duty to use our private information and their expertise to help us. \n01:09:30 Speaker 2 \nAnd this is not. You don’t need to invent the wheel, this is already there, and it’s obvious that if they use it to manipulate us, or if they sell it to a third party to manipulate us, it’s basically against the law. They can go to prison for that, and we should have the same thing with with AI. And we talked a lot about the dangers of AI. \n01:09:52 Speaker 2 \nBut obviously AI has enormous positive potential, otherwise we would not be developing it. It could provide us with the best healthcare and history it could prevent both car accidents. \n01:10:04 Speaker 2 \nIt it can also you know you can have an armies of AI doctors and teachers and therapists who help us. \n01:10:13 Speaker 2 \nIncluding help us understand our own humanity, our own relationships, our own emotions better. This can happen if we make the right decisions in the. \n01:10:26 Speaker 2 \nNext few years. \n01:10:27 Speaker 2 \nI would end maybe by saying that again the, the, the, the it’s not that we lack the power. \n01:10:34 Speaker 2 \nAt the present moment, what we lack is the understanding and the attention. \n01:10:39 Speaker 2 \nThis is potentially the biggest technological revolution in history, and it’s moving extremely fast, but that’s the key problem. It’s just moving extremely fast. If you think about the US elections the coming weeks, elections. So whoever wins the elections over the next four years, some of the most important decisions they will have to make. \n01:11:02 Speaker 2 \nWould be about AIS. \n01:11:04 Speaker 2 \nAnd regulating AI’s and AI safety and and and and so forth. And it’s not one of the main issues in the presidential debates. It’s not even clear what is the difference, if there is one between Republicans and Democrats on AI, so on specific issues, we start seeing differences. \n01:11:24 Speaker 2 \nWhen it comes to issues of freedom of speech and regulation and so forth, but about the broader question, it’s it’s it’s not clear at all. \n01:11:33 Speaker 2 \nAnd again, the the biggest danger of all is that we will just rush forward without thinking and without developing the mechanisms to to to, to slow down or to stop if necessary. \n01:11:49 Speaker 2 \nYou know, if you think about it like like a car. So when they told me how to drive a car, the first thing I learned is how to use the brakes. \n01:11:59 Speaker 2 \nBut the first thing that I think that teach most people. \n01:12:03 Speaker 2 \nOnly after you know how to use the brakes, they teach you how to use the fuel pedal. They accelerate and it’s the same when you learn how to ski. I never learned how to ski, but people who had told me the first thing they tell you is how to how to stop, how to fall. It’s a bad idea to 1st teach you how to kind of, OK. \n01:12:16 Speaker 1 \nHey, Janice. \n01:12:23 Speaker 2 \nGo faster and then when you are down the slope they start shouting. OK, this is. \n01:12:27 Speaker 2 \nHow you stop? \n01:12:28 Speaker 2 \nAnd this is what we’re doing with AI. \n01:12:31 Speaker 2 \nLike you have this cause of people in places like Silicon Valley, let’s go as fast as we can if. \n01:12:37 Speaker 2 \nThere is a problem down. \n01:12:38 Speaker 2 \nThe road, we’ll figure it out how to stop. \n01:12:41 Speaker 2 \nThat’s very, very dangerous. \n01:12:43 Speaker 1 \nYou all before you go, let me ask you one final final question and it’s news. We could all use you are writing this whole book about AI and technology and you do not carry a smartphone. \n01:12:57 Speaker 1 \nIs this true? \n01:12:58 Speaker 2 \nI have a kind of, you know, emergency smartphone because for various services, but I don’t carry it with me, it’s like. \n01:13:01 Speaker 1 \nHow does your whole life work? Because. \n01:13:04 Speaker 1 \nI’m told you do not carry a phone. You don’t have an e-mail the whole. \n01:13:07 Speaker 1 \nThing. \n01:13:08 Speaker 2 \nNo, I have e-mail. \n01:13:08 Speaker 1 \nI have e-mail. \n01:13:09 Speaker 2 \nI don’t have and I try to use technology but not to be used by it. \n01:13:16 Speaker 2 \nAnd part of the answer is that they have a team who is carrying the smartphone and doing all that for me. \n01:13:25 Speaker 2 \nSo it’s not so fair to say that I don’t, I don’t have it. But I think on on a on a bigger issue, what we can say it’s it’s a bit like with food. \n01:13:36 Speaker 2 \nThat 100 years ago, food was scarce, so people ate. \n01:13:42 Speaker 2 \nWhatever they could, and if they found something full of sugar and fat, they ate as much of it as possible because it gave you a lot of energy. \n01:13:52 Speaker 2 \nAnd now we are flooded by enormous amounts of food and junk food which is artificially pumped full of fat and sugar and is creating immense health problems. And most people have realized that more food is not always good for me and that I need to have some kind of diet. \n01:14:14 Speaker 2 \nAnd it’s exactly the same with information. When the information died, a previously information was scarce, so we consumed whatever we could find. Now we are flooded by enormous amounts of information, and much of it is junk information which is artificially filled with hatred. \n01:14:34 Speaker 2 \nAnd greed and fear. And we basically need to grow on an information diet. \n01:14:41 Speaker 2 \nAnd consume less information. \n01:14:44 Speaker 2 \nAnd be far more mindful about what we put inside that information is the food for the mind. And you know, you feed your mind with unhealthy information. You’ll have sick mind. It’s as simple as that. \n01:14:59 Speaker 1 \nWell, we want to thank you, ball add Nexus to your information diet because it’s an important document, our future and our world and want to thank you for this fascinating conversation. Thank you. And thank you for your questions. \n01:15:07 Speaker 1 \nAbout. \n01:15:11 Speaker 2 \nThank you. \n01:15:20 Speaker 3 \nWant to dive deeper?

Our information is failing  us  Yuval Noah Harari.mp3 \n \nTranscript \nWho is supposed to be the arbiter of truth between the human and the computer together, do you think? That AI will actually help us. Let me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans only have relationships? With AI. What is your worst case fear about? All of this. \nI’m Ivan mahari. I’m a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the author of Nexus, A History of information networks from the Stone Age to AI. If you consider, for instance, that we have managed to reach the Moon to split the atom to the cipher DNA, and yet with all our knowledge and wisdom, we are on the verge of destroying ourselves and a traditional answer to this question. Is that there is something wrong in human nature, but the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. If you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. So why is it that the quality of our information did not improve over thousands of years of history? Why is it that very sophisticated societies in the 20th and 21st century? Have been as susceptible as Stone Age tribes to mass delusion and psychosis, and the rise of destructive ideologies like Stalinism or Nazism. \nGood. Everybody, thank you for being here. It is a privilege for me to be here with you, Val. I’ve been a long time fan of his back. When Sapiens was first published, and there is so much to talk about. Between then and now, and how we think about AI and how we think about this new reality, something that I think was actually a theme in your earliest books about reality and truth and information. And in a world where it’s going to become all electronic and in a cloud, in the sky, in a whole new way, what it ultimately means when you think about history. So thank you for being. Here we’re going to. Talk about so many things, but I’m going to tell you where we want to start tonight. If I could. I want to read you something. This is you, you said. That humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation. But the way these networks are built. Else predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our problem then is a network problem. You call it, but even more specifically, you say it’s an information problem. I want you. To try to unpack that for the audience this evening, because I think that that more than anything else in this book explains, or at least sets the table for what this discussion is all about. \nSo basically the the key question of the book, and of much of human history is if we are so smart, why are we so stupid? That’s the key question. I mean, we can, you know, we can reach the moon, we can split the atom, we can create an eye. And yet we are on the verge of destroying ourselves. And not just through one way, like previously. We just said nuclear our war to destroy ourselves. Now we’ve created an entire menu of ways to destroy ourselves. \nSo. \nWhat is happening and you know one basic answer in many mythologies is that there is something wrong with human nature. That we reach for powers that we don’t know how to use wisely, that there was really something deeply wrong with us. And the answer that I try to give in the book is that the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. That if you go, if you give good people bad information, they will make bad decisions, self-destructive decisions and this has been happening again and again in history. Because information isn’t truth, and information isn’t wisdom. The most basic function of information is connection. Information connects many people to a network, and unfortunately the easiest way to connect large numbers of people together is not with the truth, but with fictions and fantasies and delusions. \nWhat it? \nWas going to say there’s there’s a sense, though, that information was supposed to set us free. Information access to information across the world was the was the thing that was supposed to make us a a better, a better planet. \nWhy would we do that? \nWell, there was a sense that people in in, in places that didn’t have access to communication tools and other things didn’t have access to information and didn’t have access and maybe to put a point on it to. Good information. You make the argument and now to go back to Sapiens. Frankly, you talk about different types of realities and this is what I think is very interesting because you talk about objective reality. You know, we can go outside and we can see that it’s not raining and the sky is blue. And you’d say that’s an objective reality, right? But then there are these other kinds of realities that you talk about, which makes us, I think, susceptible to what you’re describing. When I say susceptible this idea that we as a group, as humanity that we are storytellers and that we are OK, oddly enough with what you’ve described as a fictional. Reality. \nYeah, I mean. To take an example, suppose we want to build an atom bomb. To do that, suppose that’s false. Somebody wants to build an atom bomb. \nSuppose just. \nYou need to know some facts to build an atom bomb. You need some hold on objective physical reality. If you don’t know that E equals MC square. If you don’t know the fact of physics, you will not be able to build an atom bomb, but to build an atom bomb you need something else. Besides knowing the fact of physics. You need millions and millions of people. For it. Not just the physicists, but also the miners who mine uranium and the engineers and builders who build the reactor, and the farmers that grow rice and wheat in order to seed all the physicists and engineers and miners and so forth. And how do you get millions of people to cooperate? A project like building an atom bomb, if you just tell them the fact of physics look in equals MC square. Now go to it. Nobody would do it. It’s not inspiring. It it doesn’t mean anything in this sense of giving motivation. You always need to tell them some kind of fiction fantasy and the people who invent the fictions are far more powerful than the people who know the facts, physics. In Iran today, the nuclear physicists are getting their orders from people who are experts in Shiite. In Israel, increasingly, the physicists in the Soviet Union, they got it from Communist ideologues Germany. It’s usually the people who know how to read the story that give orders to the people who merely know. Facts of of of Nuclear Physics and one last point crucial point is that when if you build the bomb and ignore the fact of physics, the bomb will not explode. But if you build a story and ignore the facts of history and biology and whatever, the story still explodes. And usually with a much bigger bank. \nAnd so one of the underlying conceits of this book. In my mind, as a reader is that you believe that AI is going to be used for these purposes? \nYeah. \nAnd that AI ultimately is going to be used as a storyteller to tell untruths and unwise stories, and that those who have the power behind this AI are going to be able to use it in this way. Do you believe it’s that people are going to use the AI? In the wrong way, or that the AI is going to use the AI in the wrong way? \nInitially it will be the. People. But if we are not careful, it will get out of our control and it will be the AI. I mean, maybe we start by saying something about the definition of of AI, because it’s now kind of this buzzword which is everywhere and there is so much hype around it that it’s becoming difficult to understand what it is. Whenever they try to sell you something, especially in the financial markets, they tell you it’s an AI. This is an AI chair and this is an AI table. And this is an AI coffee machine. So buy it. And So what is AI? So if you take a coffee machine as an example, not every automatic machine is an AI, even though it knows how to make coffee. When you press a button, it’s not an AI. It’s simply doing whatever it was pre programmed by humans to do for something to be an AI, it needs the ability to learn and change by itself. And ultimately to make decisions and create new ideas by itself. So if you approach the coffee machine and the coffee machine on its own accord tells you, hey, good morning, Andrew. I’ve been watching you for the last couple of weeks. And based on everything I learned about you and your facial expression and then the hour of the day and whatever. I predict that you would like an espresso, so here I made you an espresso. Then it’s an AI and it’s really an AI. If it says an actually, I’ve just invented a new drink called best Pretzel, which is even better. I think you would like it better for it took the liberty to make some for you. When it can make decisions and create new ideas by itself. And once you create something like that, then obviously the potential for it to get out of control and to start manipulating you is there and that’s the big issue. \nAnd so how far away do you think we are from that? \nWhen Openai developed GPT 4 like two years ago, they did all kinds of tests. What can this thing do? So one of the tests they gave are GPD for was to solve capture puzzles that. When you access. A web page, a bank, or something you may want to know. You’re a human being, or you’re a bot, so you are. You have these twisted letters and symbols. \nAnd this is or the 9 squares and it says which one has something with four legs in it and you see the animal and click the animal. \nYeah. All these kinds of things. Yeah. And GPT 4 couldn’t solve it. But GPD 4 access. Task Rabbit, which is an online site where you can hire people to do. All kinds of things for you. And you know, these captures were developed so humans can solve them. But AI, I still struggle with. So it wanted to hire a human. That’s interesting. The human got suspicious. The human asked why do you need somebody to solve the culture? Puzzles are. You a robot? And at that point, GPT 4 said no, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment, which is why I have difficulty with these captures. \nSo and how to lie? \nIt it had basically theory of mind. On some level it it it knew what you know. There’s so many different explanations. And lies you. Can tell, he told a very, very effective lie. It’s the kind of life that occupation improve, but I’m not going to ask any more questions about it. I will just take the word of GPT for for it. And nobody told it to lie, and nobody told it. Which lie will be most effective? It landed. The same way that humans and animals learn things by interacting. With the world. \nLet me ask you a different. Question. To the extent that. You believe that the computer will be able to do this to us. \nWill with the. \nHelp of the computer we be able to avoid these problems on the other side, meaning there’s a cat and mouse game here and and the question is between the human and the computer together, will we be able to be more powerful and maybe power or is good or bad but be able to get at truth? \nThen. \nIn a better way. \nPotentially yes. I mean the the point of talking about it, of writing a book about it is that it’s not too late and that also the AI’s are not inherently evil or malevolent. It’s a question of how we shape this technology. We still have the power. We are still at the present moment. We are still far more powerful than the AIS. They in very narrow domains like playing chess or playing golf. They are becoming more intelligent than us, but we still have a huge edge. Nobody knows for how many more years, so we need to use it and make sure that we direct the development of this technology. Are in in a safe. Direction. OK, so. \nI’m going to make you king for the day. What would you do? How would you? Would you regulate these things? How what? What is it exactly in? In an environment. And world where we don’t have global regulators, we don’t have people who like to interact and even talk to each other anymore. Frankly, where we’ve talked about regulating social media, at least in the United States for the past 15 years now. And have done next to nothing. How we would get there, what that looks like? \nYou know, there are many regulations we should enact right now and we can talk about that. One key regulation is make social media corporations liable for the actions of their algorithms, not for the actions of their users and for the. Sections of the the corporate algorithms and another key regulation that AIS cannot pretend to be human beings. They can interact with us only if they identify as AIS. But beyond all these specific regulations, the key thing is institutions. Nobody is able to predict. How this is going to play out, how this is going to develop in the next 5-10, fifty years? So any any thought that we can now kind of regulate in advance it’s it’s impossible. No rigid regulation will be able to deal with what we are facing. We need living institutions. That have the best human talent and also the best technology. That can identify problems as they develop and react on the fly, and we are living in an era in which there is growing hostility towards institutions. But what we’ve learned again and again throughout history, is that all institutions are able to deal with these things, not single. Individuals and not some kind of miracle regulations. \nPlay it out. What is the the and and you play it out in the book a little bit when it comes to dictators and your real fears. What is the your worst case fear about? \nOK. \nAll of this. \nOne of the problems with AI is that there isn’t just like this single nightmare scenario with nuclear weapons. One of the good things about nuclear weapons it it was very easy for everybody to understand the danger, because there was basically one extremely dangerous scenario. Nuclear war. With AIS, because they are, they are not tools like atom bombs, they are agents. That that’s the most important thing to understand about them. An atom bomb, ultimately, is a tool in our hand. All decisions about how to use it and how to develop it. Humans make these decisions. AI is not a tool in our hand. It’s an autonomous agent. That, as I said, can make decisions and can invent ideas by itself, and therefore by definition, there are hundreds of dangerous scenarios that are many of them we cannot predict because they are coming from a non human intelligence. But think differently than us. You know the the acronym AI. It traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it should stand for alien intelligence. Not in the sense that coming from outer space in the sense that it’s an alien kind of intelligence, it thinks. Differently than a human being, and it’s not artificial because an artifact, again, is something that we create and. Small and this is now as the potential to go way beyond what we can predict and control still from all the different scenarios, the one which I think are speaks to to my deepest fears and also to to humanity’s deepest fears is. Being trapped. In a world of delusions created by AI, you know the fear of robots rebelling against humans and shooting people and whatever. This is very new. This goes back a couple of decades, maybe to the mid 20th. But for thousands of years, humans have been haunted by a much deeper fear. We know that our societies are ultimately based on stories. And there was always the fear that we will just be trapped inside the world of illusions and delusions and fantasies, which we mistake for reality. And will not be able to escape from, but will lose all touch with truth with reality. \nPart of that exists today. \nYeah. And, you know, it goes back to the parable of The Cave in Platos to losophy of a group of prisoners chained in a cave facing a blank wall, a screen. And there are shadows projected on this screen and they mistake the shadows for reality. And you have the same fears in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy of the world of Maya. The world of illusions. And AI is kind of the perfect tool. To create it. We are already seeing it being created all around. If the main metaphor of the early Internet age was the web, the World Wide Web and the web connects everything. So now the main metaphor is the cocoon. It’s the web which closes on us, and I live inside 1 information. And you live inside maybe a different information cocoon and there is absolutely no way for us to communicate because we live in separate different reality. \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies, and let me read you something from the book because I think it speaks to maybe even this election here in the United States, the definition of democracy as a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms stands in sharp contrast to a common misconception. That equates democracy only with elections. Elections are a central part of the Democratic toolkit, but they are not democracy. In the absence of additional self correcting mechanisms, elections can easily be rigged. Even if the elections are completely free and fair by itself, this too doesn’t guarantee democracy for democracy is not the same thing as. And this one’s interesting. Majority dictatorship. What do you? Bye, Matt. \nWhat many things, but I mean on the most basic level, just so in Venezuela that you can hold elections and if the dictator has the power to rig the elections, so it means nothing. The great advantage of democracy is that it corrects itself. It has this mechanism that you try something, but people try something. They vote for a party for a leader. Let’s try this bunch of policies for a couple of years. If it doesn’t work well, we can now try something else. That the the basic ability to say we made the mistake, let’s try something else. This is democracy. In putting Russia, you cannot say that we made a mistake. Let’s let’s try somebody else in democracy. You can. But there is a problem here. You give so much power for limited time. You give so much power. To a leader, to a party. To enact certain policies. But then what happens is that leader or party utilizes the power that the people gave them not to enact a specific time limited policy, but to gain even more power and to make it impossible to get rid of them anymore. It was always one of the key problems of democracy that you can use democracy to gain power and then use the power you have to destroy democracy. Everyone said it in in Turkey, I think best that, he said. Democracy is like a tram, like a. Train you take it until you reach the destination, then you go down. You don’t stay on the train. Ah. And. For most of history, large scale democracy was really impossible because democracy in essence is a conversation between a large number of people. And in the ancient world, you could have this conversation in a tribe, in a village, in a city state like Athens or Republican Rome. But you could not have it in a large Kingdom with millions of people because there was no technical means to hold the conversation. So we don’t know of any example. Of a large scale democracy before the rise of modern information technology in the late modern age, so democracy is built on top of information tech. Logic and when there is a big change in information technology like what is happening right now in the world, there was an earthquake. In the structure built on top of it. \nWho was supposed to be the arbiter of truth in these democracies? And the reason I raised this issue is we we have a big debate going on in this country right now about free speech and how much information we’re supposed to know what access to information we’re supposed to get. \nYeah. \nMark Zuckerberg just came out a couple weeks ago and said that, you know, there was information during the pandemic that he was suppressing that in retrospect, he wishes now he wasn’t suppressing. \nMm-hmm. \nThis gets to the idea of truth, and it also gets to the idea of what information you said. Information is not. Truth, yeah. Are we supposed to get access to all of it and decipher what’s real ourselves? Is somebody else supposed to do it for us? And will AI? Ultimately, be that arbiter. \nSo there are a couple of of of of different questions here, one about free speech and the other about who is supposed to most important thing is that free speech includes the freedom to tell lies, to tell fictions, to tell fantasies. So it’s not the same as the question of truth. Ideally, in the democracy you also have the. Freedom to lie. You also have the freedom to spread directions. \nThe ideal is why is that ideal? \nAnd and this is something that is crucial to understand, because the tech giants, they are constantly confusing the question of truth with the question of free speech. And there are two different questions. We don’t want a kind of truth police that constantly tells human beings what they can and cannot say. There are, of course limits even to that, but ideally yes, people should be able to also tell fictions and fantasies and so forth. This is information, it’s not true. The crucial role. Of this feeling out of this ocean of information. The rare and costly kind of information, which is truth. This is the role of several different, very important institutions in society. This is the role of scientists. This is the role of journalists. This is the role of judges. And the role or the aim of these institutions is not to limit the freedom of speech of the of the people, but to tell us what is the truth. Now the problem we now face is that there is a sustained. Attack. On these institutions and on the very notion that there is truth because the dominant worldview in large parts of both the left and the right on the left takes a mouse’s shape, and on the right the populist shape. They tell us that the only reality is power. All, all the world, all the universe, all reality is just power. The only thing humans want humans want is power and any human interaction like we have in this conversation is just a power struggle. And in every such interaction, when somebody tells you something. The question to ask, and this is what Donald Trump meets Karl Marx, and they shake hands. They agree on that when somebody tells you something, the question to ask is not what is. Is it true? There is no such thing. The question to ask is who is winning and who is losing? Whose privileges like what I have just said, whose privileges are being served by. And the idea is that when scientists, journalists, judges, people at large, they are only in pursuing power. And this is an extremely cynical and destructive view which undermines all institutions. Luckily, it’s not true. Especially when we look at ourselves, if we start to understand humanity just by looking at ourselves, most people will say yes, I want some power in life, but it’s not the only thing I want. I actually want truth. Also, I want to know the truth about myself, about my life. The truth about the world, and the reason that there is this deep yearning for truth, is that you can’t really be happy. If you don’t know the truth about yourself and about your life, if you look at these, people are obsessed with power. People like Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump, they have a lot of power. They don’t seem to be particularly happy. And when you realize that I’m a human being and I I really want to know at least some truth about life, why isn’t it true also of others? And yes, there are problems in institutions. There are, there is corruption, there is influence. And so. But This is why we have a lot of different institutions. \nI’m going to throw another name at you. You talked about Putin, you talked about Trump, you talked about Netanyahu. He’s not a politician, but he might want to be some. Point. Elon Musk. \nHmm. \nWhere do you put him in this? And the reason I ask? Talking about truth and information, he’s somebody who said that he wants to set all information free because he believes that if the information is free, he says that you, all of us, will be able to find and get to the. Truth, there are others. \nMHM. \nWho believe that all of that information. It will obscure the truth. \nI think that it’s a very naive view of information and truth. The idea that you just open the floodgates and let information flood the world and the truth will somehow rise to the top. You don’t know anything about history. If this is what? You think? It just doesn’t work like that. The truth? Again, it’s costly. It’s well, like, if you want to write a true story in the newspaper or an academic paper or whatever, you have to research so much. It’s very difficult. Takes a lot of time, energy, money. If you want to create some fiction, it’s the easiest thing in the world. Similarly, the truth is often very complicated because reality is very complicated, whereas fiction and fantasy can be made as simple as possible, and people in most cases they like simple stories and the truth is often painful. Whether you think about and the truth about entire countries. \nRight. \nOr the truth about individuals. The truth is often unattractive. It’s painful. We don’t want to know. For instance, the pain that we inflict sometimes on people in our life or on ourselves. Because the truth is, is costly and it’s complicated and it can be painful in a completely kind of free fight. It will lose. This is why we need institutions. Like newspapers or like academic institutions, and once again something very important about the tech giants. My problem with Facebook and and and Twitter and so forth. I don’t expect them to censor their users. We have to be very, very careful about censoring the expression of real human beings. My problem is the algorithms. Yes, even the even when they’re not telling the truth, we’re very careful about censoring the the the, the free expression of human beings. My problem is with the algorithms. \nEven when they’re telling the truth, even when they’re telling untruths. \nThat if you look at the historical case, like the massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar in 20/16/2017, in which thousands of of people were murdered, 10s of thousands were raped, and hundreds of thousands were expelled and are still refugees in Bangladesh and elsewhere. This ethnic cleansing campaign was fueled by a propaganda campaign that are generated intense hatred among Buddhists, bunnies in Myanmar against the Rohingya. Now this campaign to a large extent took place on Facebook. And the Facebook algorithms played a very central role in it. Now, whenever these accusations have been made and they have been made by amnesty in the United Nations and so forth. Facebook basically said, but we don’t want to censor the free expression of people that all these conspiracy theories about the Rohingya, that they are all terrorists and they want to destroy us. They were created by human beings. And who are we? Facebook. The fans of them. And the problem there is that the role of the algorithms. Was at that point was not in creating the stories, it was in disseminating in spreading particular stories, because people in Myanmar were creating a lot of different kinds of content. In 20/16/2017, the war hate filled conspiracy theories, but there are also sermons on compassion. In cooking lessons and biology lessons and so much content. And in the battle between for human attention, what will get the attention of the users in Myanmar, the algorithms of the Kingmakers and the algorithms were given by Facebook. A clear and simple goal. Increase user engagement. Keep more people, more time on the platform because this is the basis for once still is for, for Facebook. ’S business model. Now the algorithms and this goes back to AIS that make decisions by themselves and invent ideas by themselves. Nobody in Facebook wanted them to be an ethnic cleansing campaign. Most of them didn’t know anything about Myanmar and what was happening there. They just told the algorithms, increased user engagement, and the algorithms experimented on millions of human Guinea pigs. And they discovered that if you press the hate button and the seal but. In the human mind, you keep that human glued to the screen, so they deliberately started spreading hate filled conspiracy theories and not. Cooking lessons or summers on on compassion and this is the expectation, don’t censor. The users, but if your algorithms deliberately spread hate and fear because this is your business model, it’s on you. This is your fault. \nOK. But I’m gonna make it more complicated. I’m going to make it more complicated. And the reason we we’re talking about Facebook and and Elon Musk. Is that the algorithms that are effectively building these new AI agents are scraping all of this information. Off of these sites, this human user generated content which we’ve decided everybody should be able to see, except once the AI’s see it, they will see the conspiracy theories. They will see the misinformation and the question is how the AI agent will ever learn what’s real and what’s not. \nThat is a very, very old question that you know the editor of. The New York. Times the editor of the Wall Street Journal have dealt with this question before. Why do we need to start again? As if there has never been any history? Like the question, there is so much information out there. How should I know what’s true or not? People have been there before. If you run Twitter or Facebook, you are running one of the biggest media companies in the world, so take a look at what media companies have been dealing with in the previous generations and previous centuries. It’s basic. \nThey should be liable for what’s on their sites right now. \nThe the tech companies. \nThe tech companies should be liable for for the user generated content. \nThey should be. Liable. No, they should be liable for the actions of their algorithms. If their algorithms decided to put at the top of the news feed a hate filled conspiracy theory, it’s on them not on the person who created the conspiracy theory in the 1st place. The same way that you know, like the chief editor of the New York Times, designed to put a hateful conspiracy theory at the top of the of the first page of the New York Times. And when you come and and tell them what have you done, they say I haven’t done anything. I didn’t write it. I just decided to put it on the front page of the New York Times. That’s all. That’s not. That’s a huge thing. Editors have a lot more power than the authors to create the. Very cheap to create content. The really key point is what gets the attention. You know, I’ll give you an example from thousands of years ago. That when Christianity began. There were so many. Stories circulating about Jesus and about the disciples and about the Saint. Anybody could invent a story in that, Jesus said. And there was no Bible. There was no New Testament in the time of Jesus or 100 years after Jesus or even 200 years after Jesus. There are lots and lots of stories and texts and parable. At a certain point. The leaders of the Christian Church in the 4th century, they said this cannot go on like this. We have to have some order in this flood of information. How would Christians know what information to value, which texts to read and what are forgeries of whatever that they should just ignore? And their hands are two church councils in Hippo and in Carthage today in Tunisia in the late 4th century. And this is where they they didn’t write the texts. The texts were written generations previously, but so many different people. They decided what will get into the Bible and what will stay out. The book didn’t come down from heaven in its coming complete fall. There was a committee that decided which of all the texts will get in and, for instance, they decided that are a text which claimed to be written by Saint Paul. But many scholars today believe that it wasn’t written by Saint Paul. The First Epistle to Timothy. Which was a very misogynistic text which said basically the role of women is to be silent and to build children. This got into the Bible, whereas another text, the acts of Paul and Thecla, which portrayed Sheckler as a disciple of Saint Paul, are preaching and leading the Christian. Community and doing miracles and so forth. They said. Nah, let’s leave that one out. And the views of billions of Christians for almost 2000 years. About women and their capacities and their role in the church in the community, it was decided and not by the authors of First Timothy and the Act of politics. But by this church committee, who sat in what is today Tunisia and went over all these things and decided this will be in, and this will be out, this is enormous power. The power of curation, the editorial power, you know, you think about the the role of newspapers in, in, in, in modern politics. It’s the editors who have the most power learning before he was dictator of the Soviet Union is one job, was chief editor of Isra. And Mussolini also first was a journalist when he was editor. Immense power and now the editors increasingly are the algorithms. You know, I’m here partly on. The book too. And I know that my number one customer. Is is the algorithm? Like if I can get the algorithm to recommend my book, the humans will follow. So is it an immense power? And. That’s above my pay grade. I mean, I’m just sitting here on the stage talking with you. We’ll do this. We’ll do that, we’ll. Put it like this. Realize the immense power of the recommendation algorithm. The editor this comes with responsibility. So then I don’t think that we should hold Twitter or Facebook responsible for what the users, right. And we should be very careful about censoring users even when they say when they write lines. But we should hold the companies responsible for the choices. And the decisions of their algorithms. \nYou talked now about Lenin, and we’ve talked about all sorts of dictators. One of the things. You talk about in the book is the prospect. That AI could be used to turn a democracy into totalitarian state? Yeah, I thought was fascinating. Because it would really require AI to cocoon all of us in a unique way, telling some kind of story that captures an entire country. How would that work in your mind? \nAnd then we don’t see reality. We see the information. That we are exposed. And if you have better technology to to create and to control information, you have a much more powerful technology to control humans. Previously, there was always limitations to how much a central authority could control what people see and think and do. Even if you think about the most totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. Like the US saw or Nazi Germany, they couldn’t really follow everybody all the time. It was technically impossible. Like if you have 200 million Soviet citizens to follow them around all the time, 24 hours a day, you need about 400 million KGB. Agents because even KGB agents need to sleep. Sometimes they need to eat. Sometimes they need 2 shifts. So 200 million citizens. You need 400 million. Agents you don’t. Have 400 million KGB agents, even if you. You still have a bigger problem because let’s say that two agents follow each citizen 24 hours a day. What are they doing? The end, they write a report. This is like 1940 or 1960. It’s paper. They write a paper report. So every day KGB headquarters in Moscow is flooded. With 200 million reports about each citizen where they went, what they read, who they meant, somebody needs to analyze all the information they where do they get the analysts? It’s absolutely impossible, which is why even in the Soviet Union. Privacy will feel the default. You never knew who is watching and who is listening, but most of the time nobody was watching and listening. And even if they were, most likely the report about you would be buried in some place in the archives of the KGB. Nobody would ever read it. Now both problems of surveillance are solved by AI to follow all the people of the country 24 hours a day, you do not need millions of human agents. You have all these digital agents, the smartphones, the computers, the microphones and so forth. You can put the whole population under 24 hour surveillance and you don’t need human analysts to analyze all the information you have. AI INS to do it? \nWhat do you make of the idea that an entire generation has given up on? The idea of privacy. Right. We all put our pictures on Instagram and Facebook and all of these sites we hear about a security hack at some website and we go back the next day and try to buy and put our credit card on the same site again. We say that we’re very anxious about privacy. We we. \nWe love to. \nTell people how anxious we are about the. And then we do things that are the complete opposite. \nBecause there is. Immense pressure on us to do them. Part of it is is despair. And people still cherish privacy and part of the problem is that we haven’t seen the consequences yet yet yet we will see them quite soon. It’s like this huge experiment conducted on billions of of human Guinea pigs, but we still haven’t seen the consequences of this. Annihilation. Of privacy and it is extremely, extremely dangerous. Again, going back to the freedom of speech issue, part of this crisis of freedom of speech is the erosion of the difference between private and public. That there is a big difference. If there’s just the two of us are sitting alone somewhere talking just you and me. Or if there is an entire audience and it’s public now, I’m a very big believer in the right to stupidity. People have a right to be stupid in private. But when you talk in private with your best friends, with your family, whatever you have a right to be really stupid, to be offensive as a gay person, I would say that even politicians, if they tell homophobic jokes in a private situation with their friends, this is none of my business. And it’s actually good that politicians would have situations where they can just relax and say the first stupid thing that pops up in the. This should not happen in public. \nNow it’s going to be entered into the. \n1. \nAlgorithm. Yes, and this inability. To know what that anything they say, even in private, cannot go viral. So there is no difference, and this is extremely harmful. Part of what’s happening now in the world is this kind of tension. Between organic animals, we are organic animals and an inorganic digital system which is increasingly controlling and shaping the entire world. Now part of being an organic entity is that you live by cycles, day and night. Winter and summer growth and decay. Sometimes you are active, sometimes you need to relax and to rest. Are algorithms and AIS and computers? They are not organic, they never need rest. They are on all the time. And the big question is whether we adapt to them or they adapt to us and and more and more. Of course we have to adapt to them. We have to be on all the time. The new cycle is always on and everything we see, even when we are supposedly relaxing with friends, it can be public. So the whole of life becomes like this one long job. Any stupid thing you did in some college when you are 18, it can meet you down the road. And this is destructive. To how we function. We even think about the market like Wall Street. As far as I know, it’s open Monday to Friday is 9:30 to 4:00 in the afternoon, likely from Friday at 5 minutes past four, a new war erupted in the Middle East. The market will react only on Monday. It is still running by organic cycles now. What would happen to human bankers and finance citizens? What is happening when the market is always active? You can never relax. \nWe’ve got some. \nQuestions I think that are going to come out here on, on cards, which I want to ask in just a moment. I have a couple of questions before we get to them. One is, have you talked to folks like Sam Altman who runs open AI or the folks at Microsoft and Know Bill Gates was a big fan of your books in the past or the folks at Google? What do they say? When you discuss this with them, and do you trust them as humans when you’ve met them, do you go? I trust you, Sam Altman. \nMost of them are afraid they understand. \nAfraid of you or afraid of AI? \nAfraid of what? What they are doing? Afraid of what is happening. They understand better than anybody else their potential, including the destructive potential of what they are creating. And they are very afraid of it. At the same time, their basic stick is that I’m a good guy and I’m very concerned about it. Now you have these other guys, they are bad. They don’t have the same kind of responsibilities that I have. So it would be very bad for humanity if they create it first. So I must be the one. Operated first and you can trust me that I will know. I will at least do my best. To to to keep it under and everybody else saying it. And I think that to to some extent they are genuine about it. There is of course also this. Another element in in there of extreme kind of pride and hubris, but they are doing the most important thing in basically not just the history of humanity, the history of life. \nDo you think they are? \nThey could be, yes, if you think about the timeline of the universe, at least as far as. We know it. So you have basically two stops. First, stop 4 billion years ago, the first organic life forms in merge on Planet Earth, and then for 4 billion years nothing major happens. Like for four million years. It’s more of the same. It’s more organic stuff. So you have amoebas and you have dinosaurs and you have. Humans, but it’s all organic. And then here comes Elon Musk, or some Altman, and that’s the second important thing in the history of the universe. The beginning of inorganic evolution. Because AI is just the very, very beginning of its evolutionary process, is basically like 10 years or 15 years old. We haven’t seen anything yet deep 4:00 and all these things, they are the amoebas of AI evolution. And who knows how the AI dinosaurs are going to look like, but the the name. On the inflection point of the history of the universe, if that name is Elon Musk or that name is sent out, one that’s a big thing. \nWe’ve got a a bunch of really great questions and actually one of them is where I wanted to go before we even got to these. So we’re just go straight to it. We’re gonna make. It’s actually a bit of a right turn of a question given the conversation, though, you mentioned that Netanyahu on point. So the question here on the card says you’re Israeli. Do you really think that the Israel Palestinian conflict is solvable? And I thought actually that was an important question because it actually touches on some of these larger issues that you’ve raised about humanity. \nSo on on one level, absolutely yes, it’s not like one of these kind of mathematical problems that we have and mathematical proof that there is no solution to this problem. No, there are all solutions to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It is because it’s not a conflict about objective reality. It’s not a conflict about land or food or resources that you say, OK, there is just not enough food. Somebody have to starve to death or there is not enough land. Somebody has to be thrown in. See, this is not the case. There is enough food between the Mediterranean and Jordan to feed everybody. There is enough energy. There is even enough land. Yes, it’s a very crowded place, but technically there is enough space to build houses and synagogues and mosques and factories and hospitals and schools for everybody. So there is no objective. Voltage. But you have people each in their own information cocoon, each with their own mass delusion, each with their own fantasy, are basically denying either the existence of the other side or the right of the other side to exist. And the war is basically an attempt. To make the other side disappear, like my mind, there’s no space in it. It’s not that the land has no space for the people. My mind has no space in it for the other people. So I will try to make them disappear the same way they don’t exist in my mind. They also must not exist. In reality. And this is on both sides. And again, it’s not an objective problem. It’s a problem of what is inside the minds of people, and therefore there there is a solution to it. Unfortunately, there is no motivation. \nWhat is the solution? For someone who grew up there who’s lived there? You’re. You’re not there right now. Right, I’m here, right? Now you’re here right now. \nYeah. \nNo. \nAgain, if you go back, say, to the two state solution, it’s it’s completely workable solution in objective terms. And you can divide the land and you can divide the resources so that side by side you have a Palestinian state and you have an Israel and Israel and they are both. They both exist and they are both viable and they both provide security and prosperity and dignity to their citizens, to their inhabitants. \nHow how would you? How would you do that though, because part of the part of the issue is is a chicken and egg issue here, it seems like where the Israelis or Netanyahu would say, look, unless we are fully secure and we feel completely good about our security, we can’t really even. \nWhat? \nEntertain a conversation just about anything else, right? And the. Palestinians on the. Other side effectively say the opposite, which is to say that we need. You you need to. Solve our our our issues here. \nBoth sides of the problems both sides are right. Each side thinks that the other side is trying to annihilate it, and both are right. This is the problem. \nAnd both are right, but tell them that’s. A problem if both are right. \nOur minds it’s very difficult to change the minds of other people, the first crucial. That is to say, these are the people. They exist, and they have the right to exist. The issue is that both sides suspect that they don’t think that we should exist any compromise that they would make is just because they are now a bit weak. So they will are willing to compromise on something, but deep in their hearts they think we should not exist, so that sooner or later, when they are stronger, when they have the opportunity, they will destroy us. And again, this is correct. This is what is in the hearts and minds of both sides. So the place. Start is to you know inside first our heads. Come to recognize that the other side exists and it has a right to exist that even if someday will have the power to completely annihilate them, we shouldn’t do it because they have a right to exist. And this is something. We can do for us. \nOK, let me ask you, let me ask you a question. I think. People in Israel would say that people in Palestine have a right to exist. \nYeah. \nThere is a you don’t believe that you don’t. You think that’s not? \nThe case, unfortunately for a significant percentage of the citizens of Israel and certainly of the members of the present governing coalition, this is not the case. \nAnd you think they have no right to exist? Because I was going to say they would say that they feel that the Palestinians. \nThey. \nWant to annihilate them and do you? \nBelieve that yes, they. And then they think that the Palestinians want to annihilate us and they are right. They do want to annihilate us. But also again, I would say I don’t have the numbers to give you, but a significant part of the Israeli public and a very significant part of the. Current ruling coalition in Israel, they want to drive the Palestinian completely from from the land. And maybe they say we are now too weak, so we can’t do it. We have to compromise them only to do a little bit. But ultimately this is what they really think and want and at least some members of the coalition are completely open about it and their messianic fantasy. They actually want a bigger and bigger. War. They want to set the entire Middle East on fire. Because they think that when the smoke would clear, yes, there will be hundreds of thousands of casualties. It will be very difficult. It will be terrible, but in the end we’ll have the entire land to ourselves and there will not be any more Palestinians between the Mediterranean and and the Jordan. \nLet me ask you one other very political question as it relates to this and actually we have a great segue back into our conversation about AI as it happens. Politically here in the US, we have an election. \nMHM. \nAnd there’s some very interesting questions about how former President Trump, if he were to become the president, would be good or bad for Israel. I think there’s a perception that he would be good for Israel. You. May disagree and what you think, Vice President Harris, if she was the president, would be good or bad for Israel, or good or bad. For the Palestinians. How do you see that? \nAnd I I can’t predict what each will decide, but it’s very clear that President Trump is undermining the global order. He’s in favor of chaos. He is in favor of destroying the liberal global order that we had for the previous couple of decades and which provided the with all the problems with all the difficulties, the most peaceful era in human history. And when you destroy order then you have no alternatives. What you get is chaos. And I don’t think that chaos is good for Israel or that chaos is good for, for the, for the. Jews for the Jewish people. And This is why I think that it will be very even from a very kind of transactional, very narrow perspective. You know, America is a long, long way from Israel, from the Middle East. An isolationist America that withdraws from the world order is not good news for Israel. \nSo what do you say to the there are there? Are there are a number of American Jews who say, and I’m Jewish and I I this is not something that I say, but I hear it constantly. They say Trump would be good for the Jews. Trump would be good for Israel. He would protect Israel. \nIn in in what way? \nHe would have a open checkbook and send the military arms and everything that was asked no questions as. \nLong as it serves his interests and if at a particular point it serves his interests to make a deal with Putin or with Iran or with anybody. It is really expense. You will do it. \nFair enough. \nI mean, he’s not committed. \nI asked the question to provoke an answer. Let me ask you. Let me ask you this, and this is a great segue back into the conversation we’ve been having the last hour you’ve written about. Human how humans have evolved to pursue power. And and knowledge but. Power, I think, is the big focus. How does the pursuit? Of happiness fit into the narrative. \nHmm. And I I don’t think that humans are kind of obsessed only with power. I think that power is relatively superficial thing in the human condition. It’s a means to achieve various ends. It’s it’s not necessarily bad, it’s not that power is always bad. No, it can be used for good. It can be used for bad. But the deep motivation of humans, I think, is the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of truth, which are related to one another, because you can never really be happy if you don’t know the truth about yourself, about your life. Unfortunately, as often happens, the means becomes an end. That people become obsessed with power, not with what they can do with it. That immense power, and they don’t know what to do with it. All they do with it, very bad things. \nThis is this is an interesting one. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans no longer have relationships with other humans and only have relationships with AI? \nHmm. One thing to say about it is that AI is becoming better and better at understanding our feelings, our emotions, and therefore of developing relationships and intimate relationships with us. Because there is a deep yearning in human beings to be under. Food we always want people to understand us, to understand how we feel. We want my husband, my parents, my teachers, my boss, to understand how I feel. And very often we are disappointed. They don’t understand how I, how I feel, partly because they are too preoccupied with their own feelings to care about my feel. Thanks. AI’s will not have this problem. They don’t have any feelings of their own, and they can be 100% focused on deciphering, on analyzing your feelings. So you know, in these all these science fiction movies in which the robots are extremely cold and mechanical and they can’t understand the most basic human emotion. It it’s it’s a complete opposite. Part of the issue we are facing is that they will be so good at understanding human emotions and reacting in a way which is exactly calibrated to your personality at this particular moment that we might become exasperated with the human beings. We don’t have this capacity. To understand our emotions and to react in in such. A calibrated way. There is a very big question which we didn’t deal with and it it it’s a long question of whether AI’s will develop. Emotions, feelings of their own, whether they become conscious or not. At present, we don’t see any sign of it. But even if AI’s don’t develop any feelings of their own, once we become emotionally attached to them. It is likely that we would start treating them as our conscious entities as sentient beings, and will confirm confirm them. The legal status of of persons you know in in the US there is actually a legal path already open for that. Are corporations according to U.S. law, are legal persons. They have rights, their freedom of freedom of speech. For instance. Now you can incorporate an AI. When you incorporate a corporation like Google or Facebook or whatever up and until today, this was to some extent just make believe because all the decisions of the corporations had to be made by human beings, by the executives, the lawyers, the accountants. What happens if you incorporate an AI? It’s not a legal person, and it can make decisions by itself. It doesn’t need any human team to run it. So you start having legal persons, let’s say in the US, which are not human. And in many ways are more intelligent than us, and they can start making money, for instance, going on task rabbit and offering their services to various things like writing texts. So they earn money, and then they go to the to to, to, to the market they go to Wall Street and they invest that money. And because they’re so intelligent. Maybe they make billions and so you have a situation in which perhaps the richest person. In the US, is not a human being, and part of their rights is that they have honest final speech, the right to make political contributions. So this AI person can contribute billions of dollars to some candidate in exchange for getting more rights to AIS. \nNow lobby is. Where is this going? So there’ll be an AI president. I’m hoping you’re going to leave. Me. Leave all of us. Maybe on a high note here with something optimistic. Here’s the question, and it’s my final question. Humans are not always able to think from other perspectives. Is AI able to think from multiple perspectives? I think the answer is yes, but do you think that AI will actually help us think this way? \nYeah. That’s one of the positive scenarios about AI that they will help us understand ourselves better. That their immense power will be used not to manipulate us, but to help us. And then we have historical precedents for that. Like we have relationships with our humans, like doctors, like lawyers, accountants, therapists that are know a lot of things about us. Some of, like our most private information, is held by these people and they have a fiduciary duty to use our private information and their expertise to help us. And this is not. You don’t need to invent the wheel, this is already there, and it’s obvious that if they use it to manipulate us, or if they sell it to a third party to manipulate us, it’s basically against the law. They can go to prison for that, and we should have the same thing with with AI. And we talked a lot about the dangers of AI. But obviously AI has enormous positive potential, otherwise we would not be developing it. It could provide us with the best healthcare and history it could prevent both car accidents. It it can also you know you can have an armies of AI doctors and teachers and therapists who help us. Including help us understand our own humanity, our own relationships, our own emotions better. This can happen if we make the right decisions in the. Next few years. I would end maybe by saying that again the, the, the, the it’s not that we lack the power. At the present moment, what we lack is the understanding and the attention. This is potentially the biggest technological revolution in history, and it’s moving extremely fast, but that’s the key problem. It’s just moving extremely fast. If you think about the US elections the coming weeks, elections. So whoever wins the elections over the next four years, some of the most important decisions they will have to make. Would be about AIS. And regulating AI’s and AI safety and and and and so forth. And it’s not one of the main issues in the presidential debates. It’s not even clear what is the difference, if there is one between Republicans and Democrats on AI, so on specific issues, we start seeing differences. When it comes to issues of freedom of speech and regulation and so forth, but about the broader question, it’s it’s it’s not clear at all. And again, the the biggest danger of all is that we will just rush forward without thinking and without developing the mechanisms to to to, to slow down or to stop if necessary. You know, if you think about it like like a car. So when they told me how to drive a car, the first thing I learned is how to use the brakes. But the first thing that I think that teach most people. Only after you know how to use the brakes, they teach you how to use the fuel pedal. They accelerate and it’s the same when you learn how to ski. I never learned how to ski, but people who had told me the first thing they tell you is how to how to stop, how to fall. It’s a bad idea to 1st teach you how to kind of, OK. \nHey, Janice. \nGo faster and then when you are down the slope they start shouting. OK, this is. How you stop? And this is what we’re doing with AI. Like you have this cause of people in places like Silicon Valley, let’s go as fast as we can if. There is a problem down. The road, we’ll figure it out how to stop. That’s very, very dangerous. \nYou all before you go, let me ask you one final final question and it’s news. We could all use you are writing this whole book about AI and technology and you do not carry a smartphone. Is this true? \nI have a kind of, you know, emergency smartphone because for various services, but I don’t carry it with me, it’s like. \nHow does your whole life work? Because. I’m told you do not carry a phone. You don’t have an e-mail the whole. Thing. \nNo, I have e-mail. \nI have e-mail. \nI don’t have and I try to use technology but not to be used by it. And part of the answer is that they have a team who is carrying the smartphone and doing all that for me. So it’s not so fair to say that I don’t, I don’t have it. But I think on on a on a bigger issue, what we can say it’s it’s a bit like with food. That 100 years ago, food was scarce, so people ate. Whatever they could, and if they found something full of sugar and fat, they ate as much of it as possible because it gave you a lot of energy. And now we are flooded by enormous amounts of food and junk food which is artificially pumped full of fat and sugar and is creating immense health problems. And most people have realized that more food is not always good for me and that I need to have some kind of diet. And it’s exactly the same with information. When the information died, a previously information was scarce, so we consumed whatever we could find. Now we are flooded by enormous amounts of information, and much of it is junk information which is artificially filled with hatred. And greed and fear. And we basically need to grow on an information diet. And consume less information. And be far more mindful about what we put inside that information is the food for the mind. And you know, you feed your mind with unhealthy information. You’ll have sick mind. It’s as simple as that. \nWell, we want to thank you, ball add Nexus to your information diet because it’s an important document, our future and our world and want to thank you for this fascinating conversation. Thank you. And thank you for your questions. About. \nThank you."

    "text": "Transcript \n00:00:00 \nWho is supposed to be the arbiter of truth between the human and the computer together, do you think? \n00:00:07 \nThat AI will actually help us. \n00:00:10 \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans only have relationships? \n00:00:20 \nWith AI. \n00:00:22 \nWhat is your worst case fear about? \n00:00:24 \nAll of this. \n00:00:26 \nI’m Ivan mahari. I’m a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the author of Nexus, A History of information networks from the Stone Age to AI. \n00:00:38 \nIf you consider, for instance, that we have managed to reach the Moon to split the atom to the cipher DNA, and yet with all our knowledge and wisdom, we are on the verge of destroying ourselves and a traditional answer to this question. \n00:00:58 \nIs that there is something wrong in human nature, but the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. \n00:01:09 \nIf you give good people bad information, they make bad decisions. So why is it that the quality of our information did not improve over thousands of years of history? Why is it that very sophisticated societies in the 20th and 21st century? \n00:01:29 \nHave been as susceptible as Stone Age tribes to mass delusion and psychosis, and the rise of destructive ideologies like Stalinism or Nazism. \n00:01:56 \nGood. \n00:01:56 \nEverybody, thank you for being here. It is a privilege for me to be here with you, Val. I’ve been a long time fan of his back. When Sapiens was first published, and there is so much to talk about. \n00:02:10 \nBetween then and now, and how we think about AI and how we think about this new reality, something that I think was actually a theme in your earliest books about reality and truth and information. \n00:02:23 \nAnd in a world where it’s going to become all electronic and in a cloud, in the sky, in a whole new way, what it ultimately means when you think about history. So thank you for being. \n00:02:34 \nHere we’re going to. \n00:02:36 \nTalk about so many things, but I’m going to tell you where we want to start tonight. If I could. I want to read you something. This is you, you said. \n00:02:44 \nThat humankind gains enormous power by building large networks of cooperation. But the way these networks are built. \n00:02:53 \nElse predisposes them to use power unwisely. Our problem then is a network problem. You call it, but even more specifically, you say it’s an information problem. \n00:03:08 \nI want you. \n00:03:09 \nTo try to unpack that for the audience this evening, because I think that that more than anything else in this book explains, or at least sets the table for what this discussion is all about. \n00:03:23 \nSo basically the the key question of the book, and of much of human history is if we are so smart, why are we so stupid? \n00:03:34 \nThat’s the key question. \n00:03:36 \nI mean, we can, you know, we can reach the moon, we can split the atom, we can create an eye. And yet we are on the verge of destroying ourselves. And not just through one way, like previously. We just said nuclear our war to destroy ourselves. Now we’ve created an entire menu of ways to destroy ourselves. \n00:03:58 \nSo. \n00:03:59 \nWhat is happening and you know one basic answer in many mythologies is that there is something wrong with human nature. \n00:04:10 \nThat we reach for powers that we don’t know how to use wisely, that there was really something deeply wrong with us. \n00:04:17 \nAnd the answer that I try to give in the book is that the problem is not in our nature. The problem is in our information. \n00:04:26 \nThat if you go, if you give good people bad information, they will make bad decisions, self-destructive decisions and this has been happening again and again in history. \n00:04:39 \nBecause information isn’t truth, and information isn’t wisdom. The most basic function of information is connection. \n00:04:49 \nInformation connects many people to a network, and unfortunately the easiest way to connect large numbers of people together is not with the truth, but with fictions and fantasies and delusions. \n00:05:05 \nWhat it? \n00:05:05 \nWas going to say there’s there’s a sense, though, that information was supposed to set us free. \n00:05:09 \nInformation access to information across the world was the was the thing that was supposed to make us a a better, a better planet. \n00:05:19 \nWhy would we do that? \n00:05:23 \nWell, there was a sense that people in in, in places that didn’t have access to communication tools and other things didn’t have access to information and didn’t have access and maybe to put a point on it to. \n00:05:34 \nGood information. \n00:05:36 \nYou make the argument and now to go back to Sapiens. Frankly, you talk about different types of realities and this is what I think is very interesting because you talk about objective reality. You know, we can go outside and we can see that it’s not raining and the sky is blue. And you’d say that’s an objective reality, right? \n00:05:55 \nBut then there are these other kinds of realities that you talk about, which makes us, I think, susceptible to what you’re describing. When I say susceptible this idea that we as a group, as humanity that we are storytellers and that we are OK, oddly enough with what you’ve described as a fictional. \n00:06:15 \nReality. \n00:06:17 \nYeah, I mean. \n00:06:19 \nTo take an example, suppose we want to build an atom bomb. \n00:06:25 \nTo do that, suppose that’s false. Somebody wants to build an atom bomb. \n00:06:25 \nSuppose just. \n00:06:31 \nYou need to know some facts to build an atom bomb. You need some hold on objective physical reality. If you don’t know that E equals MC square. If you don’t know the fact of physics, you will not be able to build an atom bomb, but to build an atom bomb you need something else. Besides knowing the fact of physics. \n00:06:53 \nYou need millions and millions of people. \n00:06:56 \nFor it. \n00:06:58 \nNot just the physicists, but also the miners who mine uranium and the engineers and builders who build the reactor, and the farmers that grow rice and wheat in order to seed all the physicists and engineers and miners and so forth. And how do you get millions of people to cooperate? \n00:07:18 \nA project like building an atom bomb, if you just tell them the fact of physics look in equals MC square. Now go to it. Nobody would do it. It’s not inspiring. \n00:07:30 \nIt it doesn’t mean anything in this sense of giving motivation. You always need to tell them some kind of fiction fantasy and the people who invent the fictions are far more powerful than the people who know the facts, physics. \n00:07:50 \nIn Iran today, the nuclear physicists are getting their orders from people who are experts in Shiite. \n00:07:58 \nIn Israel, increasingly, the physicists in the Soviet Union, they got it from Communist ideologues Germany. \n00:08:12 \nIt’s usually the people who know how to read the story that give orders to the people who merely know. \n00:08:20 \nFacts of of of Nuclear Physics and one last point crucial point is that when if you build the bomb and ignore the fact of physics, the bomb will not explode. But if you build a story and ignore the facts of history and biology and whatever, the story still explodes. \n00:08:41 \nAnd usually with a much bigger bank. \n00:08:44 \nAnd so one of the underlying conceits of this book. \n00:08:49 \nIn my mind, as a reader is that you believe that AI is going to be used for these purposes? \n00:08:54 \nYeah. \n00:08:56 \nAnd that AI ultimately is going to be used as a storyteller to tell untruths and unwise stories, and that those who have the power behind this AI are going to be able to use it in this way. Do you believe it’s that people are going to use the AI? \n00:09:15 \nIn the wrong way, or that the AI is going to use the AI in the wrong way? \n00:09:21 \nInitially it will be the. \n00:09:22 \nPeople. But if we are not careful, it will get out of our control and it will be the AI. I mean, maybe we start by saying something about the definition of of AI, because it’s now kind of this buzzword which is everywhere and there is so much hype around it that it’s becoming difficult to understand what it is. \n00:09:41 \nWhenever they try to sell you something, especially in the financial markets, they tell you it’s an AI. This is an AI chair and this is an AI table. And this is an AI coffee machine. So buy it. \n00:09:53 \nAnd So what is AI? So if you take a coffee machine as an example, not every automatic machine is an AI, even though it knows how to make coffee. When you press a button, it’s not an AI. \n00:10:07 \nIt’s simply doing whatever it was pre programmed by humans to do for something to be an AI, it needs the ability to learn and change by itself. \n00:10:19 \nAnd ultimately to make decisions and create new ideas by itself. So if you approach the coffee machine and the coffee machine on its own accord tells you, hey, good morning, Andrew. I’ve been watching you for the last couple of weeks. And based on everything I learned about you and your facial expression and then the hour of the day and whatever. \n00:10:41 \nI predict that you would like an espresso, so here I made you an espresso. Then it’s an AI and it’s really an AI. If it says an actually, I’ve just invented a new drink called best Pretzel, which is even better. I think you would like it better for it took the liberty to make some for you. \n00:11:02 \nWhen it can make decisions and create new ideas by itself. \n00:11:06 \nAnd once you create something like that, then obviously the potential for it to get out of control and to start manipulating you is there and that’s the big issue. \n00:11:21 \nAnd so how far away do you think we are from that? \n00:11:28 \nWhen Openai developed GPT 4 like two years ago, they did all kinds of tests. What can this thing do? So one of the tests they gave are GPD for was to solve capture puzzles that. \n00:11:44 \nWhen you access. \n00:11:45 \nA web page, a bank, or something you may want to know. \n00:11:48 \nYou’re a human being, or you’re a bot, so you are. You have these twisted letters and symbols. \n00:11:53 \nAnd this is or the 9 squares and it says which one has something with four legs in it and you see the animal and click the animal. \n00:11:54 \nYeah. \n00:11:59 \nAll these kinds of things. \n00:12:00 \nYeah. \n00:12:02 \nAnd GPT 4 couldn’t solve it. But GPD 4 access. \n00:12:07 \nTask Rabbit, which is an online site where you can hire people to do. \n00:12:13 \nAll kinds of things for you. \n00:12:15 \nAnd you know, these captures were developed so humans can solve them. But AI, I still struggle with. \n00:12:22 \nSo it wanted to hire a human. That’s interesting. The human got suspicious. \n00:12:31 \nThe human asked why do you need somebody to solve the culture? Puzzles are. \n00:12:36 \nYou a robot? \n00:12:39 \nAnd at that point, GPT 4 said no, I’m not a robot. I have a vision impairment, which is why I have difficulty with these captures. \n00:12:49 \nSo and how to lie? \n00:12:51 \nIt it had basically theory of mind. On some level it it it knew what you know. There’s so many different explanations. \n00:12:59 \nAnd lies you. \n00:13:00 \nCan tell, he told a very, very effective lie. \n00:13:03 \nIt’s the kind of life that occupation improve, but I’m not going to ask any more questions about it. I will just take the word of GPT for for it. \n00:13:14 \nAnd nobody told it to lie, and nobody told it. Which lie will be most effective? It landed. \n00:13:22 \nThe same way that humans and animals learn things by interacting. \n00:13:27 \nWith the world. \n00:13:30 \nLet me ask you a different. \n00:13:31 \nQuestion. To the extent that. \n00:13:33 \nYou believe that the computer will be able to do this to us. \n00:13:38 \nWill with the. \n00:13:38 \nHelp of the computer we be able to avoid these problems on the other side, meaning there’s a cat and mouse game here and and the question is between the human and the computer together, will we be able to be more powerful and maybe power or is good or bad but be able to get at truth? \n00:13:46 \nThen. \n00:14:00 \nIn a better way. \n00:14:02 \nPotentially yes. I mean the the point of talking about it, of writing a book about it is that it’s not too late and that also the AI’s are not inherently evil or malevolent. It’s a question of how we shape this technology. We still have the power. \n00:14:20 \nWe are still at the present moment. We are still far more powerful than the AIS. They in very narrow domains like playing chess or playing golf. They are becoming more intelligent than us, but we still have a huge edge. Nobody knows for how many more years, so we need to use it and make sure that we direct the development of this technology. \n00:14:43 \nAre in in a safe. \n00:14:44 \nDirection. OK, so. \n00:14:45 \nI’m going to make you king for the day. \n00:14:48 \nWhat would you do? How would you? Would you regulate these things? How what? What is it exactly in? \n00:14:53 \nIn an environment. \n00:14:54 \nAnd world where we don’t have global regulators, we don’t have people who like to interact and even talk to each other anymore. Frankly, where we’ve talked about regulating social media, at least in the United States for the past 15 years now. \n00:15:08 \nAnd have done next to nothing. \n00:15:11 \nHow we would get there, what that looks like? \n00:15:14 \nYou know, there are many regulations we should enact right now and we can talk about that. One key regulation is make social media corporations liable for the actions of their algorithms, not for the actions of their users and for the. \n00:15:30 \nSections of the the corporate algorithms and another key regulation that AIS cannot pretend to be human beings. They can interact with us only if they identify as AIS. But beyond all these specific regulations, the key thing is institutions. \n00:15:51 \nNobody is able to predict. \n00:15:54 \nHow this is going to play out, how this is going to develop in the next 5-10, fifty years? So any any thought that we can now kind of regulate in advance it’s it’s impossible. No rigid regulation will be able to deal with what we are facing. We need living institutions. \n00:16:15 \nThat have the best human talent and also the best technology. \n00:16:19 \nThat can identify problems as they develop and react on the fly, and we are living in an era in which there is growing hostility towards institutions. But what we’ve learned again and again throughout history, is that all institutions are able to deal with these things, not single. \n00:16:39 \nIndividuals and not some kind of miracle regulations. \n00:16:44 \nPlay it out. What is the the and and you play it out in the book a little bit when it comes to dictators and your real fears. What is the your worst case fear about? \n00:16:45 \nOK. \n00:16:55 \nAll of this. \n00:16:58 \nOne of the problems with AI is that there isn’t just like this single nightmare scenario with nuclear weapons. One of the good things about nuclear weapons it it was very easy for everybody to understand the danger, because there was basically one extremely dangerous scenario. \n00:17:18 \nNuclear war. \n00:17:20 \nWith AIS, because they are, they are not tools like atom bombs, they are agents. \n00:17:27 \nThat that’s the most important thing to understand about them. An atom bomb, ultimately, is a tool in our hand. All decisions about how to use it and how to develop it. Humans make these decisions. \n00:17:40 \nAI is not a tool in our hand. It’s an autonomous agent. \n00:17:46 \nThat, as I said, can make decisions and can invent ideas by itself, and therefore by definition, there are hundreds of dangerous scenarios that are many of them we cannot predict because they are coming from a non human intelligence. \n00:18:06 \nBut think differently than us. \n00:18:10 \nYou know the the acronym AI. It traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it should stand for alien intelligence. Not in the sense that coming from outer space in the sense that it’s an alien kind of intelligence, it thinks. \n00:18:26 \nDifferently than a human being, and it’s not artificial because an artifact, again, is something that we create and. \n00:18:34 \nSmall and this is now as the potential to go way beyond what we can predict and control still from all the different scenarios, the one which I think are speaks to to my deepest fears and also to to humanity’s deepest fears is. \n00:18:54 \nBeing trapped. \n00:18:56 \nIn a world of delusions created by AI, you know the fear of robots rebelling against humans and shooting people and whatever. This is very new. This goes back a couple of decades, maybe to the mid 20th. \n00:19:13 \nBut for thousands of years, humans have been haunted by a much deeper fear. We know that our societies are ultimately based on stories. \n00:19:24 \nAnd there was always the fear that we will just be trapped inside the world of illusions and delusions and fantasies, which we mistake for reality. \n00:19:37 \nAnd will not be able to escape from, but will lose all touch with truth with reality. \n00:19:43 \nPart of that exists today. \n00:19:44 \nYeah. And, you know, it goes back to the parable of The Cave in Platos to losophy of a group of prisoners chained in a cave facing a blank wall, a screen. \n00:19:59 \nAnd there are shadows projected on this screen and they mistake the shadows for reality. And you have the same fears in ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy of the world of Maya. The world of illusions. And AI is kind of the perfect tool. \n00:20:18 \nTo create it. \n00:20:19 \nWe are already seeing it being created all around. \n00:20:23 \nIf the main metaphor of the early Internet age was the web, the World Wide Web and the web connects everything. So now the main metaphor is the cocoon. It’s the web which closes on us, and I live inside 1 information. \n00:20:43 \nAnd you live inside maybe a different information cocoon and there is absolutely no way for us to communicate because we live in separate different reality. \n00:20:55 \nLet me ask you how you think this is going to impact democracies, and let me read you something from the book because I think it speaks to maybe even this election here in the United States, the definition of democracy as a distributed information network with strong self correcting mechanisms stands in sharp contrast to a common misconception. \n00:21:15 \nThat equates democracy only with elections. \n00:21:20 \nElections are a central part of the Democratic toolkit, but they are not democracy. In the absence of additional self correcting mechanisms, elections can easily be rigged. Even if the elections are completely free and fair by itself, this too doesn’t guarantee democracy for democracy is not the same thing as. And this one’s interesting. \n00:21:41 \nMajority dictatorship. \n00:21:44 \nWhat do you? \n00:21:44 \nBye, Matt. \n00:21:46 \nWhat many things, but I mean on the most basic level, just so in Venezuela that you can hold elections and if the dictator has the power to rig the elections, so it means nothing. \n00:22:01 \nThe great advantage of democracy is that it corrects itself. \n00:22:06 \nIt has this mechanism that you try something, but people try something. They vote for a party for a leader. Let’s try this bunch of policies for a couple of years. If it doesn’t work well, we can now try something else. \n00:22:20 \nThat the the basic ability to say we made the mistake, let’s try something else. This is democracy. In putting Russia, you cannot say that we made a mistake. Let’s let’s try somebody else in democracy. You can. But there is a problem here. You give so much power for limited time. You give so much power. \n00:22:41 \nTo a leader, to a party. \n00:22:44 \nTo enact certain policies. But then what happens is that leader or party utilizes the power that the people gave them not to enact a specific time limited policy, but to gain even more power and to make it impossible to get rid of them anymore. \n00:23:03 \nIt was always one of the key problems of democracy that you can use democracy to gain power and then use the power you have to destroy democracy. Everyone said it in in Turkey, I think best that, he said. Democracy is like a tram, like a. \n00:23:20 \nTrain you take it until you reach the destination, then you go down. You don’t stay on the train. \n00:23:31 \nAh. \n00:23:37 \nAnd. \n00:23:39 \nFor most of history, large scale democracy was really impossible because democracy in essence is a conversation between a large number of people. \n00:23:52 \nAnd in the ancient world, you could have this conversation in a tribe, in a village, in a city state like Athens or Republican Rome. But you could not have it in a large Kingdom with millions of people because there was no technical means to hold the conversation. So we don’t know of any example. \n00:24:13 \nOf a large scale democracy before the rise of modern information technology in the late modern age, so democracy is built on top of information tech. \n00:24:24 \nLogic and when there is a big change in information technology like what is happening right now in the world, there was an earthquake. \n00:24:34 \nIn the structure built on top of it. \n00:24:36 \nWho was supposed to be the arbiter of truth in these democracies? And the reason I raised this issue is we we have a big debate going on in this country right now about free speech and how much information we’re supposed to know what access to information we’re supposed to get. \n00:24:47 \nYeah. \n00:24:54 \nMark Zuckerberg just came out a couple weeks ago and said that, you know, there was information during the pandemic that he was suppressing that in retrospect, he wishes now he wasn’t suppressing. \n00:25:06 \nMm-hmm. \n00:25:07 \nThis gets to the idea of truth, and it also gets to the idea of what information you said. Information is not. \n00:25:12 \nTruth, yeah. \n00:25:14 \nAre we supposed to get access to all of it and decipher what’s real ourselves? Is somebody else supposed to do it for us? And will AI? \n00:25:23 \nUltimately, be that arbiter. \n00:25:26 \nSo there are a couple of of of of different questions here, one about free speech and the other about who is supposed to most important thing is that free speech includes the freedom to tell lies, to tell fictions, to tell fantasies. So it’s not the same as the question of truth. \n00:25:47 \nIdeally, in the democracy you also have the. \n00:25:49 \nFreedom to lie. \n00:25:51 \nYou also have the freedom to spread directions. \n00:25:53 \nThe ideal is why is that ideal? \n00:26:00 \nAnd and this is something that is crucial to understand, because the tech giants, they are constantly confusing the question of truth with the question of free speech. And there are two different questions. \n00:26:14 \nWe don’t want a kind of truth police that constantly tells human beings what they can and cannot say. \n00:26:23 \nThere are, of course limits even to that, but ideally yes, people should be able to also tell fictions and fantasies and so forth. \n00:26:34 \nThis is information, it’s not true. \n00:26:37 \nThe crucial role. \n00:26:40 \nOf this feeling out of this ocean of information. \n00:26:44 \nThe rare and costly kind of information, which is truth. \n00:26:50 \nThis is the role of several different, very important institutions in society. This is the role of scientists. This is the role of journalists. This is the role of judges. \n00:27:02 \nAnd the role or the aim of these institutions is not to limit the freedom of speech of the of the people, but to tell us what is the truth. Now the problem we now face is that there is a sustained. \n00:27:22 \nAttack. \n00:27:23 \nOn these institutions and on the very notion that there is truth because the dominant worldview in large parts of both the left and the right on the left takes a mouse’s shape, and on the right the populist shape. \n00:27:42 \nThey tell us that the only reality is power. \n00:27:49 \nAll, all the world, all the universe, all reality is just power. The only thing humans want humans want is power and any human interaction like we have in this conversation is just a power struggle. And in every such interaction, when somebody tells you something. \n00:28:10 \nThe question to ask, and this is what Donald Trump meets Karl Marx, and they shake hands. They agree on that when somebody tells you something, the question to ask is not what is. Is it true? There is no such thing. The question to ask is who is winning and who is losing? \n00:28:29 \nWhose privileges like what I have just said, whose privileges are being served by. \n00:28:36 \nAnd the idea is that when scientists, journalists, judges, people at large, they are only in pursuing power. And this is an extremely cynical and destructive view which undermines all institutions. \n00:28:55 \nLuckily, it’s not true. \n00:28:59 \nEspecially when we look at ourselves, if we start to understand humanity just by looking at ourselves, most people will say yes, I want some power in life, but it’s not the only thing I want. I actually want truth. Also, I want to know the truth about myself, about my life. \n00:29:19 \nThe truth about the world, and the reason that there is this deep yearning for truth, is that you can’t really be happy. \n00:29:28 \nIf you don’t know the truth about yourself and about your life, if you look at these, people are obsessed with power. People like Vladimir Putin or Benjamin Netanyahu or Donald Trump, they have a lot of power. They don’t seem to be particularly happy. \n00:29:47 \nAnd when you realize that I’m a human being and I I really want to know at least some truth about life, why isn’t it true also of others? \n00:29:59 \nAnd yes, there are problems in institutions. There are, there is corruption, there is influence. And so. But This is why we have a lot of different institutions. \n00:30:08 \nI’m going to throw another name at you. You talked about Putin, you talked about Trump, you talked about Netanyahu. He’s not a politician, but he might want to be some. \n00:30:16 \nPoint. \n00:30:17 \nElon Musk. \n00:30:18 \nHmm. \n00:30:20 \nWhere do you put him in this? And the reason I ask? Talking about truth and information, he’s somebody who said that he wants to set all information free because he believes that if the information is free, he says that you, all of us, will be able to find and get to the. \n00:30:36 \nTruth, there are others. \n00:30:37 \nMHM. \n00:30:38 \nWho believe that all of that information. \n00:30:40 \nIt will obscure the truth. \n00:30:42 \nI think that it’s a very naive view of information and truth. The idea that you just open the floodgates and let information flood the world and the truth will somehow rise to the top. \n00:30:57 \nYou don’t know anything about history. If this is what? \n00:31:00 \nYou think? \n00:31:03 \nIt just doesn’t work like that. The truth? Again, it’s costly. It’s well, like, if you want to write a true story in the newspaper or an academic paper or whatever, you have to research so much. It’s very difficult. \n00:31:19 \nTakes a lot of time, energy, money. If you want to create some fiction, it’s the easiest thing in the world. \n00:31:26 \nSimilarly, the truth is often very complicated because reality is very complicated, whereas fiction and fantasy can be made as simple as possible, and people in most cases they like simple stories and the truth is often painful. Whether you think about and the truth about entire countries. \n00:31:41 \nRight. \n00:31:47 \nOr the truth about individuals. The truth is often unattractive. It’s painful. We don’t want to know. For instance, the pain that we inflict sometimes on people in our life or on ourselves. \n00:32:03 \nBecause the truth is, is costly and it’s complicated and it can be painful in a completely kind of free fight. It will lose. This is why we need institutions. \n00:32:16 \nLike newspapers or like academic institutions, and once again something very important about the tech giants. \n00:32:25 \nMy problem with Facebook and and and Twitter and so forth. I don’t expect them to censor their users. We have to be very, very careful about censoring the expression of real human beings. \n00:32:41 \nMy problem is the algorithms. Yes, even the even when they’re not telling the truth, we’re very careful about censoring the the the, the free expression of human beings. My problem is with the algorithms. \n00:32:42 \nEven when they’re telling the truth, even when they’re telling untruths. \n00:32:57 \nThat if you look at the historical case, like the massacre of the Rohingya in Myanmar in 20/16/2017, in which thousands of of people were murdered, 10s of thousands were raped, and hundreds of thousands were expelled and are still refugees in Bangladesh and elsewhere. \n00:33:18 \nThis ethnic cleansing campaign was fueled by a propaganda campaign that are generated intense hatred among Buddhists, bunnies in Myanmar against the Rohingya. \n00:33:33 \nNow this campaign to a large extent took place on Facebook. \n00:33:40 \nAnd the Facebook algorithms played a very central role in it. Now, whenever these accusations have been made and they have been made by amnesty in the United Nations and so forth. \n00:33:52 \nFacebook basically said, but we don’t want to censor the free expression of people that all these conspiracy theories about the Rohingya, that they are all terrorists and they want to destroy us. They were created by human beings. \n00:34:07 \nAnd who are we? Facebook. The fans of them. And the problem there is that the role of the algorithms. \n00:34:17 \nWas at that point was not in creating the stories, it was in disseminating in spreading particular stories, because people in Myanmar were creating a lot of different kinds of content. In 20/16/2017, the war hate filled conspiracy theories, but there are also sermons on compassion. \n00:34:40 \nIn cooking lessons and biology lessons and so much content. \n00:34:44 \nAnd in the battle between for human attention, what will get the attention of the users in Myanmar, the algorithms of the Kingmakers and the algorithms were given by Facebook. \n00:35:00 \nA clear and simple goal. Increase user engagement. \n00:35:07 \nKeep more people, more time on the platform because this is the basis for once still is for, for Facebook. \n00:35:15 \n’S business model. \n00:35:17 \nNow the algorithms and this goes back to AIS that make decisions by themselves and invent ideas by themselves. Nobody in Facebook wanted them to be an ethnic cleansing campaign. \n00:35:30 \nMost of them didn’t know anything about Myanmar and what was happening there. They just told the algorithms, increased user engagement, and the algorithms experimented on millions of human Guinea pigs. And they discovered that if you press the hate button and the seal but. \n00:35:47 \nIn the human mind, you keep that human glued to the screen, so they deliberately started spreading hate filled conspiracy theories and not. \n00:35:59 \nCooking lessons or summers on on compassion and this is the expectation, don’t censor. \n00:36:06 \nThe users, but if your algorithms deliberately spread hate and fear because this is your business model, it’s on you. This is your fault. \n00:36:18 \nOK. But I’m gonna make it more complicated. I’m going to make it more complicated. And the reason we we’re talking about Facebook and and Elon Musk. \n00:36:25 \nIs that the algorithms that are effectively building these new AI agents are scraping all of this information. \n00:36:36 \nOff of these sites, this human user generated content which we’ve decided everybody should be able to see, except once the AI’s see it, they will see the conspiracy theories. They will see the misinformation and the question is how the AI agent will ever learn what’s real and what’s not. \n00:36:57 \nThat is a very, very old question that you know the editor of. \n00:37:02 \nThe New York. \n00:37:03 \nTimes the editor of the Wall Street Journal have dealt with this question before. Why do we need to start again? As if there has never been any history? \n00:37:14 \nLike the question, there is so much information out there. How should I know what’s true or not? \n00:37:20 \nPeople have been there before. If you run Twitter or Facebook, you are running one of the biggest media companies in the world, so take a look at what media companies have been dealing with in the previous generations and previous centuries. It’s basic. \n00:37:35 \nThey should be liable for what’s on their sites right now. \n00:37:39 \nThe the tech companies. \n00:37:40 \nThe tech companies should be liable for for the user generated content. \n00:37:42 \nThey should be. \n00:37:43 \nLiable. No, they should be liable for the actions of their algorithms. \n00:37:48 \nIf their algorithms decided to put at the top of the news feed a hate filled conspiracy theory, it’s on them not on the person who created the conspiracy theory in the 1st place. The same way that you know, like the chief editor of the New York Times, designed to put a hateful conspiracy theory at the top of the of the first page of the New York Times. \n00:38:10 \nAnd when you come and and tell them what have you done, they say I haven’t done anything. I didn’t write it. I just decided to put it on the front page of the New York Times. That’s all. That’s not. That’s a huge thing. Editors have a lot more power than the authors to create the. \n00:38:30 \nVery cheap to create content. The really key point is what gets the attention. You know, I’ll give you an example from thousands of years ago. \n00:38:40 \nThat when Christianity began. \n00:38:43 \nThere were so many. \n00:38:44 \nStories circulating about Jesus and about the disciples and about the Saint. Anybody could invent a story in that, Jesus said. \n00:38:53 \nAnd there was no Bible. \n00:38:56 \nThere was no New Testament in the time of Jesus or 100 years after Jesus or even 200 years after Jesus. \n00:39:02 \nThere are lots and lots of stories and texts and parable. At a certain point. \n00:39:09 \nThe leaders of the Christian Church in the 4th century, they said this cannot go on like this. We have to have some order in this flood of information. How would Christians know what information to value, which texts to read and what are forgeries of whatever that they should just ignore? \n00:39:29 \nAnd their hands are two church councils in Hippo and in Carthage today in Tunisia in the late 4th century. And this is where they they didn’t write the texts. The texts were written generations previously, but so many different people. \n00:39:47 \nThey decided what will get into the Bible and what will stay out. The book didn’t come down from heaven in its coming complete fall. \n00:39:58 \nThere was a committee that decided which of all the texts will get in and, for instance, they decided that are a text which claimed to be written by Saint Paul. But many scholars today believe that it wasn’t written by Saint Paul. The First Epistle to Timothy. \n00:40:19 \nWhich was a very misogynistic text which said basically the role of women is to be silent and to build children. This got into the Bible, whereas another text, the acts of Paul and Thecla, which portrayed Sheckler as a disciple of Saint Paul, are preaching and leading the Christian. \n00:40:40 \nCommunity and doing miracles and so forth. They said. Nah, let’s leave that one out. \n00:40:46 \nAnd the views of billions of Christians for almost 2000 years. \n00:40:53 \nAbout women and their capacities and their role in the church in the community, it was decided and not by the authors of First Timothy and the Act of politics. \n00:41:08 \nBut by this church committee, who sat in what is today Tunisia and went over all these things and decided this will be in, and this will be out, this is enormous power. The power of curation, the editorial power, you know, you think about the the role of newspapers in, in, in, in modern politics. \n00:41:29 \nIt’s the editors who have the most power learning before he was dictator of the Soviet Union is one job, was chief editor of Isra. \n00:41:39 \nAnd Mussolini also first was a journalist when he was editor. \n00:41:44 \nImmense power and now the editors increasingly are the algorithms. You know, I’m here partly on. \n00:41:51 \nThe book too. \n00:41:53 \nAnd I know that my number one customer. \n00:41:56 \nIs is the algorithm? \n00:41:58 \nLike if I can get the algorithm to recommend my book, the humans will follow. \n00:42:06 \nSo is it an immense power? \n00:42:09 \nAnd. \n00:42:11 \nThat’s above my pay grade. I mean, I’m just sitting here on the stage talking with you. \n00:42:19 \nWe’ll do this. We’ll do that, we’ll. \n00:42:21 \nPut it like this. \n00:42:25 \nRealize the immense power of the recommendation algorithm. The editor this comes with responsibility. \n00:42:32 \nSo then I don’t think that we should hold Twitter or Facebook responsible for what the users, right. And we should be very careful about censoring users even when they say when they write lines. But we should hold the companies responsible for the choices. \n00:42:53 \nAnd the decisions of their algorithms. \n00:42:55 \nYou talked now about Lenin, and we’ve talked about all sorts of dictators. One of the things. \n00:42:59 \nYou talk about in the book is the prospect. \n00:43:02 \nThat AI could be used to turn a democracy into totalitarian state? Yeah, I thought was fascinating. \n00:43:11 \nBecause it would really require AI to cocoon all of us in a unique way, telling some kind of story that captures an entire country. How would that work in your mind? \n00:43:25 \nAnd then we don’t see reality. We see the information. \n00:43:30 \nThat we are exposed. \n00:43:32 \nAnd if you have better technology to to create and to control information, you have a much more powerful technology to control humans. \n00:43:45 \nPreviously, there was always limitations to how much a central authority could control what people see and think and do. Even if you think about the most totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. \n00:44:01 \nLike the US saw or Nazi Germany, they couldn’t really follow everybody all the time. It was technically impossible. Like if you have 200 million Soviet citizens to follow them around all the time, 24 hours a day, you need about 400 million KGB. \n00:44:21 \nAgents because even KGB agents need to sleep. Sometimes they need to eat. Sometimes they need 2 shifts. So 200 million citizens. You need 400 million. \n00:44:29 \nAgents you don’t. \n00:44:29 \nHave 400 million KGB agents, even if you. \n00:44:33 \nYou still have a bigger problem because let’s say that two agents follow each citizen 24 hours a day. What are they doing? The end, they write a report. This is like 1940 or 1960. It’s paper. They write a paper report. So every day KGB headquarters in Moscow is flooded. \n00:44:52 \nWith 200 million reports about each citizen where they went, what they read, who they meant, somebody needs to analyze all the information they where do they get the analysts? It’s absolutely impossible, which is why even in the Soviet Union. \n00:45:10 \nPrivacy will feel the default. \n00:45:13 \nYou never knew who is watching and who is listening, but most of the time nobody was watching and listening. And even if they were, most likely the report about you would be buried in some place in the archives of the KGB. Nobody would ever read it. \n00:45:28 \nNow both problems of surveillance are solved by AI to follow all the people of the country 24 hours a day, you do not need millions of human agents. You have all these digital agents, the smartphones, the computers, the microphones and so forth. \n00:45:47 \nYou can put the whole population under 24 hour surveillance and you don’t need human analysts to analyze all the information you have. \n00:45:56 \nAI INS to do it? \n00:45:57 \nWhat do you make of the idea that an entire generation has given up on? \n00:46:02 \nThe idea of privacy. \n00:46:05 \nRight. We all put our pictures on Instagram and Facebook and all of these sites we hear about a security hack at some website and we go back the next day and try to buy and put our credit card on the same site again. We say that we’re very anxious about privacy. We we. \n00:46:23 \nWe love to. \n00:46:23 \nTell people how anxious we are about the. \n00:46:26 \nAnd then we do things that are the complete opposite. \n00:46:30 \nBecause there is. \n00:46:30 \nImmense pressure on us to do them. \n00:46:34 \nPart of it is is despair. \n00:46:37 \nAnd people still cherish privacy and part of the problem is that we haven’t seen the consequences yet yet yet we will see them quite soon. It’s like this huge experiment conducted on billions of of human Guinea pigs, but we still haven’t seen the consequences of this. \n00:46:57 \nAnnihilation. \n00:46:59 \nOf privacy and it is extremely, extremely dangerous. Again, going back to the freedom of speech issue, part of this crisis of freedom of speech is the erosion of the difference between private and public. \n00:47:15 \nThat there is a big difference. If there’s just the two of us are sitting alone somewhere talking just you and me. Or if there is an entire audience and it’s public now, I’m a very big believer in the right to stupidity. People have a right to be stupid in private. \n00:47:35 \nBut when you talk in private with your best friends, with your family, whatever you have a right to be really stupid, to be offensive as a gay person, I would say that even politicians, if they tell homophobic jokes in a private situation with their friends, this is none of my business. \n00:47:55 \nAnd it’s actually good that politicians would have situations where they can just relax and say the first stupid thing that pops up in the. \n00:48:06 \nThis should not happen in public. \n00:48:09 \nNow it’s going to be entered into the. \n00:48:09 \n1. \n00:48:11 \nAlgorithm. Yes, and this inability. \n00:48:17 \nTo know what that anything they say, even in private, cannot go viral. So there is no difference, and this is extremely harmful. Part of what’s happening now in the world is this kind of tension. \n00:48:32 \nBetween organic animals, we are organic animals and an inorganic digital system which is increasingly controlling and shaping the entire world. Now part of being an organic entity is that you live by cycles, day and night. \n00:48:52 \nWinter and summer growth and decay. Sometimes you are active, sometimes you need to relax and to rest. \n00:49:00 \nAre algorithms and AIS and computers? They are not organic, they never need rest. They are on all the time. And the big question is whether we adapt to them or they adapt to us and and more and more. Of course we have to adapt to them. We have to be on all the time. \n00:49:20 \nThe new cycle is always on and everything we see, even when we are supposedly relaxing with friends, it can be public. So the whole of life becomes like this one long job. \n00:49:33 \nAny stupid thing you did in some college when you are 18, it can meet you down the road. \n00:49:42 \nAnd this is destructive. \n00:49:44 \nTo how we function. We even think about the market like Wall Street. As far as I know, it’s open Monday to Friday is 9:30 to 4:00 in the afternoon, likely from Friday at 5 minutes past four, a new war erupted in the Middle East. The market will react only on Monday. \n00:50:03 \nIt is still running by organic cycles now. What would happen to human bankers and finance citizens? What is happening when the market is always active? You can never relax. \n00:50:15 \nWe’ve got some. \n00:50:16 \nQuestions I think that are going to come out here on, on cards, which I want to ask in just a moment. I have a couple of questions before we get to them. One is, have you talked to folks like Sam Altman who runs open AI or the folks at Microsoft and Know Bill Gates was a big fan of your books in the past or the folks at Google? \n00:50:34 \nWhat do they say? \n00:50:35 \nWhen you discuss this with them, and do you trust them as humans when you’ve met them, do you go? I trust you, Sam Altman. \n00:50:45 \nMost of them are afraid they understand. \n00:50:48 \nAfraid of you or afraid of AI? \n00:50:50 \nAfraid of what? What they are doing? Afraid of what is happening. They understand better than anybody else their potential, including the destructive potential of what they are creating. \n00:51:02 \nAnd they are very afraid of it. At the same time, their basic stick is that I’m a good guy and I’m very concerned about it. Now you have these other guys, they are bad. They don’t have the same kind of responsibilities that I have. So it would be very bad for humanity if they create it first. So I must be the one. \n00:51:23 \nOperated first and you can trust me that I will know. I will at least do my best. \n00:51:29 \nTo to to keep it under and everybody else saying it. And I think that to to some extent they are genuine about it. There is of course also this. \n00:51:39 \nAnother element in in there of extreme kind of pride and hubris, but they are doing the most important thing in basically not just the history of humanity, the history of life. \n00:51:52 \nDo you think they are? \n00:51:54 \nThey could be, yes, if you think about the timeline of the universe, at least as far as. \n00:51:59 \nWe know it. \n00:52:01 \nSo you have basically two stops. First, stop 4 billion years ago, the first organic life forms in merge on Planet Earth, and then for 4 billion years nothing major happens. Like for four million years. It’s more of the same. It’s more organic stuff. So you have amoebas and you have dinosaurs and you have. \n00:52:23 \nHumans, but it’s all organic. \n00:52:25 \nAnd then here comes Elon Musk, or some Altman, and that’s the second important thing in the history of the universe. The beginning of inorganic evolution. \n00:52:36 \nBecause AI is just the very, very beginning of its evolutionary process, is basically like 10 years or 15 years old. We haven’t seen anything yet deep 4:00 and all these things, they are the amoebas of AI evolution. \n00:52:56 \nAnd who knows how the AI dinosaurs are going to look like, but the the name. \n00:53:04 \nOn the inflection point of the history of the universe, if that name is Elon Musk or that name is sent out, one that’s a big thing. \n00:53:15 \nWe’ve got a a bunch of really great questions and actually one of them is where I wanted to go before we even got to these. So we’re just go straight to it. We’re gonna make. It’s actually a bit of a right turn of a question given the conversation, though, you mentioned that Netanyahu on point. So the question here on the card says you’re Israeli. \n00:53:33 \nDo you really think that the Israel Palestinian conflict is solvable? \n00:53:38 \nAnd I thought actually that was an important question because it actually touches on some of these larger issues that you’ve raised about humanity. \n00:53:46 \nSo on on one level, absolutely yes, it’s not like one of these kind of mathematical problems that we have and mathematical proof that there is no solution to this problem. \n00:53:59 \nNo, there are all solutions to the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It is because it’s not a conflict about objective reality. \n00:54:07 \nIt’s not a conflict about land or food or resources that you say, OK, there is just not enough food. Somebody have to starve to death or there is not enough land. Somebody has to be thrown in. \n00:54:20 \nSee, this is not the case. There is enough food between the Mediterranean and Jordan to feed everybody. There is enough energy. There is even enough land. Yes, it’s a very crowded place, but technically there is enough space to build houses and synagogues and mosques and factories and hospitals and schools for everybody. So there is no objective. \n00:54:42 \nVoltage. But you have people each in their own information cocoon, each with their own mass delusion, each with their own fantasy, are basically denying either the existence of the other side or the right of the other side to exist. \n00:55:01 \nAnd the war is basically an attempt. \n00:55:06 \nTo make the other side disappear, like my mind, there’s no space in it. It’s not that the land has no space for the people. My mind has no space in it for the other people. So I will try to make them disappear the same way they don’t exist in my mind. They also must not exist. \n00:55:27 \nIn reality. \n00:55:28 \nAnd this is on both sides. \n00:55:31 \nAnd again, it’s not an objective problem. \n00:55:34 \nIt’s a problem of what is inside the minds of people, and therefore there there is a solution to it. Unfortunately, there is no motivation. \n00:55:43 \nWhat is the solution? \n00:55:45 \nFor someone who grew up there who’s lived there? \n00:55:48 \nYou’re. You’re not there right now. \n00:55:49 \nRight, I’m here, right? \n00:55:50 \nNow you’re here right now. \n00:55:51 \nYeah. \n00:55:54 \nNo. \n00:55:55 \nAgain, if you go back, say, to the two state solution, it’s it’s completely workable solution in objective terms. \n00:56:05 \nAnd you can divide the land and you can divide the resources so that side by side you have a Palestinian state and you have an Israel and Israel and they are both. They both exist and they are both viable and they both provide security and prosperity and dignity to their citizens, to their inhabitants. \n00:56:24 \nHow how would you? How would you do that though, because part of the part of the issue is is a chicken and egg issue here, it seems like where the Israelis or Netanyahu would say, look, unless we are fully secure and we feel completely good about our security, we can’t really even. \n00:56:25 \nWhat? \n00:56:41 \nEntertain a conversation just about anything else, right? And the. \n00:56:45 \nPalestinians on the. \n00:56:46 \nOther side effectively say the opposite, which is to say that we need. \n00:56:50 \nYou you need to. \n00:56:50 \nSolve our our our issues here. \n00:56:52 \nBoth sides of the problems both sides are right. Each side thinks that the other side is trying to annihilate it, and both are right. This is the problem. \n00:57:02 \nAnd both are right, but tell them that’s. \n00:57:04 \nA problem if both are right. \n00:57:11 \nOur minds it’s very difficult to change the minds of other people, the first crucial. \n00:57:16 \nThat is to say, these are the people. They exist, and they have the right to exist. \n00:57:25 \nThe issue is that both sides suspect that they don’t think that we should exist any compromise that they would make is just because they are now a bit weak. \n00:57:38 \nSo they will are willing to compromise on something, but deep in their hearts they think we should not exist, so that sooner or later, when they are stronger, when they have the opportunity, they will destroy us. And again, this is correct. This is what is in the hearts and minds of both sides. So the place. \n00:57:58 \nStart is to you know inside first our heads. \n00:58:04 \nCome to recognize that the other side exists and it has a right to exist that even if someday will have the power to completely annihilate them, we shouldn’t do it because they have a right to exist. And this is something. \n00:58:18 \nWe can do for us. \n00:58:18 \nOK, let me ask you, let me ask you a question. \n00:58:21 \nI think. \n00:58:24 \nPeople in Israel would say that people in Palestine have a right to exist. \n00:58:28 \nYeah. \n00:58:29 \nThere is a you don’t believe that you don’t. \n00:58:31 \nYou think that’s not? \n00:58:32 \nThe case, unfortunately for a significant percentage of the citizens of Israel and certainly of the members of the present governing coalition, this is not the case. \n00:58:44 \nAnd you think they have no right to exist? Because I was going to say they would say that they feel that the Palestinians. \n00:58:46 \nThey. \n00:58:51 \nWant to annihilate them and do you? \n00:58:54 \nBelieve that yes, they. And then they think that the Palestinians want to annihilate us and they are right. They do want to annihilate us. But also again, I would say I don’t have the numbers to give you, but a significant part of the Israeli public and a very significant part of the. \n00:59:12 \nCurrent ruling coalition in Israel, they want to drive the Palestinian completely from from the land. \n00:59:20 \nAnd maybe they say we are now too weak, so we can’t do it. We have to compromise them only to do a little bit. But ultimately this is what they really think and want and at least some members of the coalition are completely open about it and their messianic fantasy. They actually want a bigger and bigger. \n00:59:41 \nWar. They want to set the entire Middle East on fire. \n00:59:45 \nBecause they think that when the smoke would clear, yes, there will be hundreds of thousands of casualties. It will be very difficult. It will be terrible, but in the end we’ll have the entire land to ourselves and there will not be any more Palestinians between the Mediterranean and and the Jordan. \n01:00:03 \nLet me ask you one other very political question as it relates to this and actually we have a great segue back into our conversation about AI as it happens. \n01:00:12 \nPolitically here in the US, we have an election. \n01:00:15 \nMHM. \n01:00:16 \nAnd there’s some very interesting questions about how former President Trump, if he were to become the president, would be good or bad for Israel. I think there’s a perception that he would be good for Israel. \n01:00:28 \nYou. \n01:00:28 \nMay disagree and what you think, Vice President Harris, if she was the president, would be good or bad for Israel, or good or bad. \n01:00:37 \nFor the Palestinians. \n01:00:39 \nHow do you see that? \n01:00:40 \nAnd I I can’t predict what each will decide, but it’s very clear that President Trump is undermining the global order. \n01:00:52 \nHe’s in favor of chaos. \n01:00:54 \nHe is in favor of destroying the liberal global order that we had for the previous couple of decades and which provided the with all the problems with all the difficulties, the most peaceful era in human history. \n01:01:14 \nAnd when you destroy order then you have no alternatives. What you get is chaos. And I don’t think that chaos is good for Israel or that chaos is good for, for the, for the. \n01:01:27 \nJews for the Jewish people. \n01:01:30 \nAnd This is why I think that it will be very even from a very kind of transactional, very narrow perspective. You know, America is a long, long way from Israel, from the Middle East. \n01:01:43 \nAn isolationist America that withdraws from the world order is not good news for Israel. \n01:01:51 \nSo what do you say to the there are there? Are there are a number of American Jews who say, and I’m Jewish and I I this is not something that I say, but I hear it constantly. They say Trump would be good for the Jews. Trump would be good for Israel. He would protect Israel. \n01:02:06 \nIn in in what way? \n01:02:11 \nHe would have a open checkbook and send the military arms and everything that was asked no questions as. \n01:02:19 \nLong as it serves his interests and if at a particular point it serves his interests to make a deal with Putin or with Iran or with anybody. \n01:02:30 \nIt is really expense. You will do it. \n01:02:33 \nFair enough. \n01:02:33 \nI mean, he’s not committed. \n01:02:38 \nI asked the question to provoke an answer. Let me ask you. Let me ask you this, and this is a great segue back into the conversation we’ve been having the last hour you’ve written about. \n01:02:47 \nHuman how humans have evolved to pursue power. \n01:02:52 \nAnd and knowledge but. \n01:02:53 \nPower, I think, is the big focus. \n01:02:55 \nHow does the pursuit? \n01:02:57 \nOf happiness fit into the narrative. \n01:03:00 \nHmm. \n01:03:01 \nAnd I I don’t think that humans are kind of obsessed only with power. I think that power is relatively superficial thing in the human condition. \n01:03:12 \nIt’s a means to achieve various ends. It’s it’s not necessarily bad, it’s not that power is always bad. No, it can be used for good. It can be used for bad. \n01:03:22 \nBut the deep motivation of humans, I think, is the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of truth, which are related to one another, because you can never really be happy if you don’t know the truth about yourself, about your life. \n01:03:39 \nUnfortunately, as often happens, the means becomes an end. \n01:03:45 \nThat people become obsessed with power, not with what they can do with it. \n01:03:52 \nThat immense power, and they don’t know what to do with it. All they do with it, very bad things. \n01:03:59 \nThis is this is an interesting one. What are some arguments for and against the future in which humans no longer have relationships with other humans and only have relationships with AI? \n01:04:14 \nHmm. \n01:04:17 \nOne thing to say about it is that AI is becoming better and better at understanding our feelings, our emotions, and therefore of developing relationships and intimate relationships with us. Because there is a deep yearning in human beings to be under. \n01:04:34 \nFood we always want people to understand us, to understand how we feel. We want my husband, my parents, my teachers, my boss, to understand how I feel. And very often we are disappointed. They don’t understand how I, how I feel, partly because they are too preoccupied with their own feelings to care about my feel. \n01:04:55 \nThanks. \n01:04:56 \nAI’s will not have this problem. They don’t have any feelings of their own, and they can be 100% focused on deciphering, on analyzing your feelings. \n01:05:10 \nSo you know, in these all these science fiction movies in which the robots are extremely cold and mechanical and they can’t understand the most basic human emotion. \n01:05:20 \nIt it’s it’s a complete opposite. \n01:05:23 \nPart of the issue we are facing is that they will be so good at understanding human emotions and reacting in a way which is exactly calibrated to your personality at this particular moment that we might become exasperated with the human beings. \n01:05:44 \nWe don’t have this capacity. \n01:05:47 \nTo understand our emotions and to react in in such. \n01:05:51 \nA calibrated way. \n01:05:53 \nThere is a very big question which we didn’t deal with and it it it’s a long question of whether AI’s will develop. \n01:06:00 \nEmotions, feelings of their own, whether they become conscious or not. At present, we don’t see any sign of it. But even if AI’s don’t develop any feelings of their own, once we become emotionally attached to them. \n01:06:16 \nIt is likely that we would start treating them as our conscious entities as sentient beings, and will confirm confirm them. The legal status of of persons you know in in the US there is actually a legal path already open for that. \n01:06:36 \nAre corporations according to U.S. law, are legal persons. They have rights, their freedom of freedom of speech. For instance. Now you can incorporate an AI. \n01:06:47 \nWhen you incorporate a corporation like Google or Facebook or whatever up and until today, this was to some extent just make believe because all the decisions of the corporations had to be made by human beings, by the executives, the lawyers, the accountants. \n01:07:06 \nWhat happens if you incorporate an AI? It’s not a legal person, and it can make decisions by itself. It doesn’t need any human team to run it. So you start having legal persons, let’s say in the US, which are not human. \n01:07:22 \nAnd in many ways are more intelligent than us, and they can start making money, for instance, going on task rabbit and offering their services to various things like writing texts. So they earn money, and then they go to the to to, to, to the market they go to Wall Street and they invest that money. And because they’re so intelligent. \n01:07:42 \nMaybe they make billions and so you have a situation in which perhaps the richest person. \n01:07:51 \nIn the US, is not a human being, and part of their rights is that they have honest final speech, the right to make political contributions. \n01:08:02 \nSo this AI person can contribute billions of dollars to some candidate in exchange for getting more rights to AIS. \n01:08:04 \nNow lobby is. Where is this going? \n01:08:15 \nSo there’ll be an AI president. \n01:08:17 \nI’m hoping you’re going to leave. \n01:08:18 \nMe. Leave all of us. \n01:08:20 \nMaybe on a high note here with something optimistic. \n01:08:24 \nHere’s the question, and it’s my final question. Humans are not always able to think from other perspectives. \n01:08:31 \nIs AI able to think from multiple perspectives? I think the answer is yes, but do you think that AI will actually help us think this way? \n01:08:35 \nYeah. \n01:08:43 \nThat’s one of the positive scenarios about AI that they will help us understand ourselves better. \n01:08:52 \nThat their immense power will be used not to manipulate us, but to help us. \n01:09:00 \nAnd then we have historical precedents for that. \n01:09:04 \nLike we have relationships with our humans, like doctors, like lawyers, accountants, therapists that are know a lot of things about us. \n01:09:16 \nSome of, like our most private information, is held by these people and they have a fiduciary duty to use our private information and their expertise to help us. \n01:09:30 \nAnd this is not. You don’t need to invent the wheel, this is already there, and it’s obvious that if they use it to manipulate us, or if they sell it to a third party to manipulate us, it’s basically against the law. They can go to prison for that, and we should have the same thing with with AI. And we talked a lot about the dangers of AI. \n01:09:52 \nBut obviously AI has enormous positive potential, otherwise we would not be developing it. It could provide us with the best healthcare and history it could prevent both car accidents. \n01:10:04 \nIt it can also you know you can have an armies of AI doctors and teachers and therapists who help us. \n01:10:13 \nIncluding help us understand our own humanity, our own relationships, our own emotions better. This can happen if we make the right decisions in the. \n01:10:26 \nNext few years. \n01:10:27 \nI would end maybe by saying that again the, the, the, the it’s not that we lack the power. \n01:10:34 \nAt the present moment, what we lack is the understanding and the attention. \n01:10:39 \nThis is potentially the biggest technological revolution in history, and it’s moving extremely fast, but that’s the key problem. It’s just moving extremely fast. If you think about the US elections the coming weeks, elections. So whoever wins the elections over the next four years, some of the most important decisions they will have to make. \n01:11:02 \nWould be about AIS. \n01:11:04 \nAnd regulating AI’s and AI safety and and and and so forth. And it’s not one of the main issues in the presidential debates. It’s not even clear what is the difference, if there is one between Republicans and Democrats on AI, so on specific issues, we start seeing differences. \n01:11:24 \nWhen it comes to issues of freedom of speech and regulation and so forth, but about the broader question, it’s it’s it’s not clear at all. \n01:11:33 \nAnd again, the the biggest danger of all is that we will just rush forward without thinking and without developing the mechanisms to to to, to slow down or to stop if necessary. \n01:11:49 \nYou know, if you think about it like like a car. So when they told me how to drive a car, the first thing I learned is how to use the brakes. \n01:11:59 \nBut the first thing that I think that teach most people. \n01:12:03 \nOnly after you know how to use the brakes, they teach you how to use the fuel pedal. They accelerate and it’s the same when you learn how to ski. I never learned how to ski, but people who had told me the first thing they tell you is how to how to stop, how to fall. It’s a bad idea to 1st teach you how to kind of, OK. \n01:12:16 \nHey, Janice. \n01:12:23 \nGo faster and then when you are down the slope they start shouting. OK, this is. \n01:12:27 \nHow you stop? \n01:12:28 \nAnd this is what we’re doing with AI. \n01:12:31 \nLike you have this cause of people in places like Silicon Valley, let’s go as fast as we can if. \n01:12:37 \nThere is a problem down. \n01:12:38 \nThe road, we’ll figure it out how to stop. \n01:12:41 \nThat’s very, very dangerous. \n01:12:43 \nYou all before you go, let me ask you one final final question and it’s news. We could all use you are writing this whole book about AI and technology and you do not carry a smartphone. \n01:12:57 \nIs this true? \n01:12:58 \nI have a kind of, you know, emergency smartphone because for various services, but I don’t carry it with me, it’s like. \n01:13:01 \nHow does your whole life work? Because. \n01:13:04 \nI’m told you do not carry a phone. You don’t have an e-mail the whole. \n01:13:07 \nThing. \n01:13:08 \nNo, I have e-mail. \n01:13:08 \nI have e-mail. \n01:13:09 \nI don’t have and I try to use technology but not to be used by it. \n01:13:16 \nAnd part of the answer is that they have a team who is carrying the smartphone and doing all that for me. \n01:13:25 \nSo it’s not so fair to say that I don’t, I don’t have it. But I think on on a on a bigger issue, what we can say it’s it’s a bit like with food. \n01:13:36 \nThat 100 years ago, food was scarce, so people ate. \n01:13:42 \nWhatever they could, and if they found something full of sugar and fat, they ate as much of it as possible because it gave you a lot of energy. \n01:13:52 \nAnd now we are flooded by enormous amounts of food and junk food which is artificially pumped full of fat and sugar and is creating immense health problems. And most people have realized that more food is not always good for me and that I need to have some kind of diet. \n01:14:14 \nAnd it’s exactly the same with information. When the information died, a previously information was scarce, so we consumed whatever we could find. Now we are flooded by enormous amounts of information, and much of it is junk information which is artificially filled with hatred. \n01:14:34 \nAnd greed and fear. And we basically need to grow on an information diet. \n01:14:41 \nAnd consume less information. \n01:14:44 \nAnd be far more mindful about what we put inside that information is the food for the mind. And you know, you feed your mind with unhealthy information. You’ll have sick mind. It’s as simple as that. \n01:14:59 \nWell, we want to thank you, ball add Nexus to your information diet because it’s an important document, our future and our world and want to thank you for this fascinating conversation. Thank you. And thank you for your questions. \n01:15:07 \nAbout. \n01:15:11 \nThank you."
